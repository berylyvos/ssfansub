1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:03,807
Writing, writing, writing.

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:07,000
Dave, send the actors down for their season one evaluations.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hi, I'm Dan Harmon. I created NBC's Community.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Community's had its ups and downs this year.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Its ups were the nights we followed 'The Office' and people left their TVs on by accident.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Its downs were the rest of the season.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,428
Within those downs, what are the reasons why we fluctuate?

8
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:26,395
What are the reasons for our victories and failures?

9
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:31,060
Well, we're going to find that out through a series of cast evaluations.

10
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:34,623
Thank you so much for coming in.

11
00:00:34,623 --> 00:00:35,623
No problem.

12
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:39,623
It's the end of the season and it's been a successful season.

13
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,623
Very successful.

14
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:44,098
Let's talk about your relationships with the other cast

15
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:45,623
and this is not going to leave this room.

16
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:47,353
This is just an aid for me to use.

17
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:48,623
I hate Alison.

18
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:49,173
You hate Alison.

19
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:49,826
Hate Alison.

20
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:51,623
What is it about her that's bugging you?

21
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:54,032
She's a girl that doesn't help.

22
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,962
I believe that all people should be men eventually.

23
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,903
Let's talk about some of the others.

24
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:05,261
Okay.

25
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,105
Joel.

26
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:06,797
Great.

27
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:07,167
Great.

28
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:07,550
Guy.

29
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,550
Gillian.

30
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:10,755
Room for improvement to her.

31
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:11,755
Room for improvement.

32
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:12,755
Due to gender.

33
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:14,160
Chevy.

34
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:15,974
Dude. Fine.

35
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:16,820
Danny.

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,434
Dude.

37
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:18,601
Yvette.

38
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:23,395
I'm not sure.

39
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:28,190
I'm simply asking a few questions of each of you guys and it doesn't leave this room.

40
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,228
Your responses.

41
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:29,907
Okay.

42
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:30,997
That's why the cameras are here?

43
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:31,651
Yeah.

44
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:34,169
Well, we may put it on the first season DVD.

45
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:34,925
Ah.

46
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:42,717
Let's just talk about the fact that Donald has a problem with you.

47
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,580
You and Alison in particular

48
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,868
he didn't get much more specific than the fact that you were women.

49
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:49,406
Yeah.

50
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:51,444
Would you care to comment on it at all?

51
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,072
Well, abusive is a word that comes to mind.

52
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,802
On his end?

53
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:55,802
Yes.

54
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,032
Racist because...

55
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:57,814
He's racist.

56
00:01:57,814 --> 00:01:59,302
Well, you noticed that he didn't say Yvette.

57
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:02,302
You said women, but he only said the two white women in the cast.

58
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:05,302
I think he might think that she's a man.

59
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:17,914
The character is different from you.

60
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,351
How?

61
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,351
Obviously, she's a little more buttoned up.

62
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:22,351
Yes.

63
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:31,249
You've been on the internet doing all kinds of outlandishly sexualized shenanigans.

64
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:32,671
Yeah, you really don't like that.

65
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:33,671
No, I do.

66
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:34,914
You really don't.

67
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:35,914
I'm fine with it.

68
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:38,078
You want me to be Annie all the time.

69
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:41,134
But let me tell you, Dan Harmon, I'm an actor.

70
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:52,064
Do you mind, as a doctor, if we could quickly go through your castmates?

71
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:52,445
Yeah.

72
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,493
And again, this doesn't get back to them in any way.

73
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:56,493
- But I could use your help as much as anybody's. - No, it's all confidential.

74
00:02:56,906 --> 00:02:58,816
Yvette Nicole Brown?

75
00:02:58,816 --> 00:02:59,988
I don't know.

76
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:01,323
She may have lupus.

77
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:02,092
She may have it now?

78
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:05,201
The prodromal symptoms tend to manifest in the hair.

79
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,201
And I've noticed that her hair has grown a little bit.

80
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:10,355
So when the hair grows, she could be dying?

81
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:11,984
Yeah, I just worry.

82
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,076
Her hair's been more frizzy throughout the season.

83
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:16,961
And then she developed a cough.

84
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:20,649
Do you remember your audition? Do you remember getting the part?

85
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:21,681
Do you remember those days?

86
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:22,681
I do remember my audition.

87
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:30,259
It was me, you, and Deva, and I auditioned for you.

88
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,578
And you said to me,

89
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,250
can I show you to my friends?

90
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,805
That was the first thing you said to me.

91
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:37,933
And I was like, sure, and then you called them in, and that was my audition.

92
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,805
And you had a soft spot in my heart because of that. I thought that was really sweet.

93
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:44,226
Ken thinks you have lupus.

94
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:49,593
Let's talk about the weaknesses on your part, which are --

95
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:53,568
Let's see here, weight. I know that's an issue.

96
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,560
You know, it's one of those things where I have a thyroid problem.

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,270
I don't know if that's listed anywhere.

98
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,224
I'll just write down the word thyroid.

99
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:10,234
Great.

100
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:10,784
Great.

101
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,437
I can't really do anything about that.

102
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:15,039
What I can do is suggest you eat a sandwich.

103
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,064
We had a 7.89 rating in the beginning.

104
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:20,064
Well, that's millions of households.

105
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:21,064
That's true?

106
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,064
Yeah, and then down to...

107
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,064
Where am I naked?

108
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,408
Episode 17, this is where you're naked.

109
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,498
I see, okay.

110
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:29,914
And the response to your naked ass...

111
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,333
Was that?

112
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,438
Low point of all year.

113
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:36,015
People running from their televisions.

114
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:38,015
I have a different theory.

115
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,015
I feel like this tracks your physical hygiene.

116
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:47,342
If you think about it, you started out the year almost looking like you do now.

117
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:50,342
Then the second episode hit because you were like, huge deal.

118
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:52,342
That's when the beard started growing.

119
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:59,089
That is when you began wearing shirts that looked like you stripped them off of Drifter's corpse.

120
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,264
And smelled that way.

121
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:04,070
I want you to level this amount of scrutiny also if you can on your castmates.

122
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,392
Because we can make improvements for next year.

123
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:10,189
Well, let's go through cast member by cast member if you don't mind.

124
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,281
Chevy, Chase.

125
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:14,912
As I've said in other interviews, I'm thrilled he's alive.

126
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:20,912
I think room for improvement on Chevy is he needs to stop analyzing the script so much.

127
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:22,304
He needs to stop reading it.

128
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:22,953
He really overthinks it.

129
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:24,737
He memorizes everyone's parts.

130
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:25,239
Yeah.

131
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:26,506
Was it my line?

132
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:27,506
I forgot the line.

133
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:29,195
What's the line you wanted me to do?

134
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:29,893
What are we doing?

135
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:30,893
Your line.

136
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,431
I forgot the fucking line, all right?

137
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,081
I knew the line before. I think you ought to lose that line.

138
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:37,611
He didn't even read his line right.

139
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,611
Oh, did you say it?

140
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:39,611
Yeah, I'm the stupid one.

141
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:40,294
I didn't even know you were here.

142
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:41,386
I'll get it this time. Ready?

143
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:42,990
Get back to your places.

144
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,990
All of you.

145
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:47,638
How's it going with the others?

146
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:50,356
You know, I don't know, really.

147
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:53,365
I don't pay much attention to them, but ...

148
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,473
it seems to me that they're all pretty good.

149
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,473
I don't think that Joel carries it, really.

150
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:02,473
I think that may be the weak area.

151
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:03,473
Problems with him.

152
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,473
So going into a second season.

153
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,215
I would replace Joel.

154
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:07,717
Okay.

155
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,717
We've been trying to use you guys in different combinations.

156
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,717
Is there anybody that you've enjoyed working with more than others?

157
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:15,769
Well, yeah.

158
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:21,197
Yeah, I'd have to say I liked very much working with Marty Short and Steve Martin.

159
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:25,105
I've got a big red check next to Alison and Gillian.

160
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:25,832
Yeah.

161
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:29,112
Chevy though, fine. Not at all.

162
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:30,577
You guys are getting along.

163
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:31,577
No, that guy's a good time.

164
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,780
Probably like the least racist guy.

165
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
To a fault.

166
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,495
To the fault where it's just like, oh,

167
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:40,584
let's go get some Chinese food and he'll just walk into a Burger King.

168
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:41,514
Right.

169
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:42,201
Because he can't even tell the difference.

170
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,201
He can't even tell the difference.

171
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:46,977
It's just like, hey man, these are burgers.

172
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:48,050
And he's like, I didn't notice.

173
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:49,868
And you're just like, god damn.

174
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:57,684
I look at this chart of our ratings and I see a potential for success.

175
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,952
I don't see obvious failure.

176
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,952
With Aldrich, I don't mean to sound offensive, but I'm being a little defensive.

177
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:07,731
That was not my fault for the 4-7 on 18 to...

178
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,104
Well, this certainly wasn't your fault.

179
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:13,232
You weren't in this episode. You joined us here.

180
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:35,190
In the pilot, you're supposedly this honest, noble-hearted, conscientious kind of character.

181
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,134
Yeah.

182
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:39,550
Are we peeling back layers or are we changing the character?

183
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,440
A little bit of both, I think.

184
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
As we peel back these layers...

185
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Wrong answer. I gave the wrong answer.

186
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,108
Is she becoming more like you, the actor?

187
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:50,754
I think, sillier than Britta.

188
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:53,570
I had to put you on the spot because I see some of the silliness.

189
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,570
Oh, sure.

190
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:58,916
She's like, just like, whoaoooooo~

191
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:04,562
Just a little, huh, huh, huh, huh.

192
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,045
Like that.

193
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,691
Gillian and I had that scene together. It was late at night.

194
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:18,240
And I looked in her eyes, and even when she wasn't on camera, she gave me so much emotion.

195
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,601
Like, I felt Britta feeling for Shirley.

196
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,368
So there was no way that I couldn't rise to the occasion for her

197
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:30,368
when she was giving me so much off-camera.

198
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:31,368
And a lot of actors don't do that.

199
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:33,368
She's amazing in that natural way.

200
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:34,149
Amazing.

201
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,446
If you're doing a natural scene with her, it's perfect.

202
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:38,446
She makes you better.

203
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:43,022
And then as soon as she tries to do a joke, everything crumbles.

204
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:48,022
She is a delightful... You know what it is? This is what I think has not happened with Gillian.

205
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:50,022
I don't think people know how goofy she is.

206
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:53,561
And now that the shows are starting to go more in how goofy she is,

207
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,209
I think her comedic talent in that area is about to really go, wow.

208
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:02,309
I know you've told me you don't watch the show on television.

209
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,836
No, I don't have a television.

210
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,836
And then you assert that that is not an attempt to impress me.

211
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:07,596
This is honest truth.

212
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:11,088
People who I speak with who are my friends back East say that

213
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:13,076
the show is getting progressively better.

214
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:13,088
Every show.

215
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:13,916
Every show.

216
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,885
And these are people I really... And now I'm being serious.

217
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:21,408
These are people I really trust who have great comic sensibilities and perspective.

218
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:23,408
Who said? Who's saying? Famous people?

219
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:26,168
No. Nobody famous.

220
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,168
Just people that you admire.

221
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,084
Yeah, good friends. Yeah.

222
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:31,084
Well, actually some of them are famous.

223
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:32,312
Harold Ramis?

224
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,571
Harold Ramis is famous.

225
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:37,832
All right, well...

226
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:38,832
We've got to wrap it up?

227
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:41,242
Yeah. Would you like to come back for another year?

228
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,056
Yeah.

229
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:50,113
Obviously, if you'd like to, I think we have a position for you next year.

230
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:52,946
It's been a pleasure to work with you this year.

231
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:53,946
Oh, fine, Ken. You too.

232
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:54,946
You're one of my favorites, secretly.

233
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,259
You're coming back for season two. I can tell you that right now.

234
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,592
People are very happy with you.

235
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:01,131
Yeah?

236
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,528
I just want to make sure that you're happy.

237
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:07,790
I'm very happy. I've never had more time taken away from my life.

238
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:11,364
I want to try to find more things to do with your character in season two.

239
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:16,164
I think one of the biggest crimes I did this year is underutilize you.

240
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:18,657
I think you're the most talented guy on the cast,

241
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:22,233
and I can't tell that to any of the others because they're...

242
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:25,233
I mean, the same thing that makes them untalented makes them insecure.

243
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:28,297
You know, I understand that it's this way in the first year,

244
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:35,910
and, of course, next year, if I show up, things will probably go quicker.

245
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,512
People are used to each other.

246
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:41,512
And, again, with Joel out, I think things will move faster.

247
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,766
All right, fine. Well, thank you so much for...

248
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,526
The pleasure was all mine, Patrick.

249
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:46,526
Yeah.

250
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:48,526
My name's Dan.

251
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:49,526
Dan.

252
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:50,334
Thank you.

253
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:51,334
Thanks for coming in.

254
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:52,888
And thank the others as well.

255
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,270
That was very eye-opening.

256
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:58,645
I hope you enjoyed it.

257
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,805
Dave, could you please cancel the show?

梧桐街2240号
2240 Sycamore.

153
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,190
没有后援能处理这个
There's no backup for this.

154
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,750
发生什么了  麦克利
What the hell happened, Macklay?

155
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,910
他死了
He's dead.

156
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,860
双R餐厅

157
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,790
你想做什么  贝基
What do you want to do, Becky?

158
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,470
我恨他  我想离开他
I hate him. I want out.

159
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,380
你想离婚吗
You want a divorce?

160
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,320
不知道  我爱他
I don't know. I love him.

161
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,660
门的钱还有损坏公寓的赔偿
You're gonna have to pay for the door

162
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,930
得由你来出
and the damage to the apartment.

163
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,280
我才不付钱给她的公寓
I'm not paying for her apartment.

164
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,740
-贝基  -我不会付的
- Becky. - I'm not going to do it.

165
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,470
再说了  我一分钱也没有
I don't have any money, anyway!

166
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,380
亲爱的
Honey,

167
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,140
要不是我是警局的人
if I didn't work for the sheriff,

168
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,630
你现在就已经在监狱里了
you'd be in jail right now.

169
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,900
我借你一些钱
I'll loan you the money.

170
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,660
不要
Ugh, no.

171
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,910
我不能再拿你的钱了  母亲
I can't take any more money from you, Mom.

172
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,740
而且他会把你给我的钱都花光
And he spent everything you ever gave me, anyway.

173
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,020
我借给你
I'll loan you the money.

174
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,670
但你之后要把钱还我
But you gotta pay me back.

175
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,510
你要把这事搞定
And you gotta make this right.

176
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,110
我们要帮你离开那拖车
And we have to get you out of that trailer

177
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,440
还要远离他
and away from him.

178
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,090
他只是处于低谷时期
He's just going through a bad time right now.

179
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,570
贝基
Becky,

180
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,290
我一直没抓他的唯一原因
the only reason I haven't busted him is,

181
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,970
是希望他能为了你回头是岸
I was hoping he would come around for you.

182
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
我现在认为这是不可能的了
I don't think that's gonna happen.

183
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,200
可是这...这会实现的  我坚信
But it-it's gonna happen. I know it will.

184
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,270
他的心还是好的
He's good inside.

185
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,120
他每天都出去找工作
He goes out every day looking for work.

186
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,400
至少我认为他有这样做的
At least I thought he did.

187
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,260
卡尔说那拖车有点不对劲
Carl said things aren't right in that trailer.

188
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,990
他有打过你吗
Has he ever hit you?

189
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,190
不  没有
N-no, no.

190
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,340
他不是...这样的人
He's not... like that.

191
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,990
别这样
Come on.

192
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,420
希望你没看错人
I hope you're right.

193
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,940
从现在开始  如果他碰你一下
From now on, if he ever touches you

194
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,870
或者有任何违法犯罪的话
or breaks the law in any way,

195
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,660
我立马抓他
I'm gonna bring him down.

196
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,190
贝基
Becky,

197
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,490
我们都知道你已经长大了还结了婚
we know that you're a grown, married woman.

198
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,650
但我们是你的父母
But we're your parents.

199
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,040
我们爱你
And we love you.

200
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,300
还有...
And...

201
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,130
我们只是...我们不想失去你
we just-- we don't want to lose you.

202
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,630
你从挡风玻璃上掉下去的时候还好吗
Oh, w-when you flew off the windshield, are you okay?

203
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,470
我很抱歉  妈妈
I'm sorry, Mom.

204
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,460
-我没事  -我不是故意的
- I'm okay. - I didn't mean to do that.

205
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,330
-我真的是无心的  -我没事  我没事
- I really didn't. - I'm okay. I'm okay.

206
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,460
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

207
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,110
你今晚跟我住一起  好吗
You're staying with me tonight, okay?

208
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,920
晚点见
See you later?

209
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,190
老地方吗
Same place?

210
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,700
所有人趴下  趴下
Everybody down! Get down!

211
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,640
特德  把灯关了
Toad, turn off the lights.

212
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,850
这是什么
What is this?

213
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,980
我的天  鲁斯
Oh, my God, Russ!

214
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,730
鲁斯  搞什么鬼
Russ, what the hell?

215
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,590
鲁斯  我的天
Russ! Oh, my God!

216
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,820
拉尔夫  他拿了把枪  鲁斯
Ralph--he's got a gun, Russ!

217
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,320
我的天  我的天啊  鲁斯
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Russ!

218
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,880
是不是你把枪放车里的
Did you put a gun in this car?

219
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,210
去你的  你是怎么想的
Damn you! What were you thinking?

220
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,600
这枪放在副驾的盒子里的
It was in the front seat in a box.

221
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,350
我根本不知道它是枪
I didn't know it was a gun!

222
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,240
他可能杀了自己
He could have killed himself!

223
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,710
他还可能把我们都杀了
He could have killed all of us!

224
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,070
它就在我的脚边  鲁斯
It was by my feet, Russ.

225
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,370
我把它移开了不想它挡道
I moved it to get it out of the way.

226
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,970
你觉得我知道它是枪的话
Do you think I would have put it

227
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,800
会把它放在后面跟拉尔夫一起吗
in the backseat of the car with Ralph if I knew it was a gun?

228
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,430
你傻的吗
Are you a fucking moron?

229
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,000
你脑子出什么问题了
What is wrong with you?

230
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,010
-女士  -什么事
- Ma'am. - Yes?

231
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,220
我在双峰镇警察局工作
I'm with the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department,

232
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,310
我是布利格斯警官
Deputy Briggs.

233
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,930
请把枪给我
Please hand me that gun.

234
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,690
好的
Okay.

235
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,390
给你
Here.

236
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,170
现在  我要你们俩的身份证
Now, I'm gonna need identification from both of you, please.

237
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,970
我刚刚在大艾德燃气农场
I was at Big Ed's Gas Farm.

238
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,270
你知道吗
And you know what?

239
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,250
我听到了枪声
I heard shots.

240
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,470
很明显  是那小孩
That kid found a gun, evidently,

241
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,730
在这车的后座找到了把枪
in the back of this van

242
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,740
然后射穿了双R餐厅的窗户
and shot through the window into the Double R.

243
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,350
这两位应该是他的父母
These are his parents, I think.

244
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,750
我要他们俩的证件
I need IDs on both of them.

245
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,940
女士  体谅一下
Ma'am, please!

246
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,730
我去叫那女人别再按喇叭
I'm gonna try and stop this woman from honking her horn

247
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,420
疏通一下道路
and get this traffic moving.

248
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,510
好的  博比
I got it, Bobby.

249
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,160
女士  麻烦别按了
Please, ma'am. Ma'am, please.

250
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
拜托你了  女士
Please, ma'am--

251
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,350
你在搞什么
What are you doing?

252
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,430
我们还要回家啊
We're trying to get home!

253
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,800
已经迟到了
We're already late.

254
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,820
晚餐迟到了  六点半已经过很久了
We're late for dinner. It's way past 6:30.

255
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,090
为什么遇到这种事
Why is this happening?

256
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,690
我看见那把枪朝窗外开枪
I saw that gun go shooting out the window.

257
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,720
她舅舅也会来
Her uncle is joining us.

258
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,370
她已经很久
She hasn't seen him

259
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,900
没有见到他了
in a very long while.

260
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,440
我们迟到了
We're late!

261
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,920
还有好几公里的路啊
We've got miles to go!

262
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,590
拜托  我们得回家了
Please, we have to get home!

263
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,660
她生病了
She's sick!

264
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,590
我的天
Oh, God!

265
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,660
双峰镇警察局

266
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,060
据我推算  我们要去的就是这
By my reckoning, this is where we're headed.

267
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,210
但那无路可走  路不通
But there's no road. The road's gone.

268
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,440
我一直在思考布里格斯少校所提供的信息
The information that Major Briggs gave got me thinking.

269
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,700
等我解释了我的地图后
You'll understand a lot more

270
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,320
你会更明白的
when I explain my map.

271
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,580
这张地图虽古老
This map is very old,

272
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,680
但永不过时
but it is always current.

273
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,280
它有生命
It's-it's a living thing.

274
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,470
这是布里格斯少校曾派驻的地方
This is where Major Briggs' station was.

275
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,250
这是蓝松山
This is Blue Pine Mountain

276
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,190
一个备受尊敬的的圣地
and a-a very revered sacred site.

277
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,010
我认为少校给我们的信息
I think that the information that the major gave us

278
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,590
要把我们指向那里
is gonna take us here.

279
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,150
这看似篝火的东西是什么
Looks like a campfire. What is this?

280
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,690
那不是篝火  是一个象征火的符号
It's not a campfire. It's-it's a-a fire symbol.

281
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,690
什么意思
What's that mean?

282
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,680
那是...
It's a...

283
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,300
一种火
a type of fire.

284
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,930
更类似于...
More like...

285
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,030
当今的电力
like modern-day electricity.

286
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,430
是好事吗
Good?

287
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,940
那要看情况  其意图为何
Depends, depends upon the intention,

288
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,430
火焰背后的意图是什么
the intention behind the fire.

289
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,950
少校也给了我们一个日期
The major also gave us a date,

290
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,640
也就是后天
day after tomorrow.

291
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,750
你观测这些星相
If you read these stars,

292
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,990
也能得出相同日期
you find that same date,

293
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,390
它会把你指向这里
and it refers you to here.

294
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,870
这是什么
What is this?

295
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,150
玉米  代表着富饶
It's corn. It's fertility.

296
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,030
但它是黑色的
But it's-it's black,

297
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,120
也就是有病害或异常的
diseased or unnatural.

298
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,310
死亡
Death.

299
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,330
若你结合这两个符号
If you put these two symbols together,

300
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,310
就会得到这个
you get this.

301
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,250
黑色火焰
Black fire.

302
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,250
没错
Correct.

303
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,580
我们在布里格斯少校的小管子里
We saw this on that little slip of paper

304
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,450
取出来的字条上有看见这个
we took out of Major Briggs' tube.

305
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,620
这是什么
What is this?

306
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,050
弗兰克
Frank...

307
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,760
你不会想知道的
you don't ever want to know about that.

308
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,360
真的吗
Really?

309
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:25,950
真的
Really.

310
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,260
我也不知道我考虑家具做什么
I don't know why I'm even thinking about furniture.

311
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,550
我和安迪几乎都不在家
Andy and I hardly ever get home.

312
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,990
有什么事  露西
What's up, Lucy?

313
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,360
玛格丽特·兰特曼找您  在二线  霍克
Margaret Lanterman for you on line two, Hawk.

314
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,560
就是我挂电话后会闪灯的那一线
That's the one that's blinking when I hang up.

315
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,380
你好  玛格丽特
Hello, Margaret.

316
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,010
霍克
Hawk?

317
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,860
听得见吗
Can you hear me?

318
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,010
可以  玛格丽特
Yes, Margaret.

319
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,690
霍克  听得见吗
Hawk, can you hear me?

320
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,050
请说  玛格丽特
Yes, Margaret.

321
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,600
你是不是发现了什么
You found something, didn't you?

322
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,920
正如你所说的
It's just like you said.

323
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,440
我很抱歉  我该告诉你的
I'm sorry, I-I should have let you know.

324
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,940
你发现了什么  霍克
What did you find, Hawk?

325
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,430
玛格丽特  我不能告诉你
Margaret, I can't tell you that.

326
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,730
我的木头害怕火
My log is afraid of fire.

327
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,540
你要去的地方有火
There's fire where you are going.

328
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,000
霍克
Hawk,

329
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,910
你要去的地方有火
there's fire where you are going.

330
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,350
好的  玛格丽特
Okay, Margaret.

331
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,390
晚安  霍克
Good night, Hawk.

332
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,850
晚安
Good night.

333
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,330
谢谢你  玛格丽特
And thank you, Margaret.

334
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,030
什么事  杰西
What is it, Jesse?

335
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,070
杜鲁门警长
Sheriff Truman,

336
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,060
你有兴趣看我的新车吗
are you interested in seeing my new car?

337
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,650
-是一台20...  -杰西
- It's a two-thousand-- - Jesse.

338
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,060
我在开会
I'm in a meeting.

339
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,370
我能明天再欣赏你的新车吗
Can I look at your new car tomorrow?

340
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,390
好
Okay.

341
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,310
谢谢  杜鲁门警长
Thank you, Sh-Sheriff Truman.

342
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,400
坐立不安啊
Cat on a hot tin roof.

343
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,630
从来不会这样的
It's never done that before.

344
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,660
我们该来一点咖啡
We're supposed to get some coffee,

345
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,620
但我想这样可能不太好
but I don't think that's a good idea.

346
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,970
咖啡
Coffee?

347
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,890
我想喝咖啡啊
I would like some coffee.

348
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,580
或许温牛奶会好一点
Maybe some warm milk.

349
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,760
因为你说...
For the cat.

350
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,470
坐立不安
On the roof?

351
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,950
对
Yes.

352
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,500
你拍的那张露丝的照片
The picture you took of Ruth.

353
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,360
我想看一下  艾伯特
I would like to see it, Albert.

354
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,150
我能在这抽烟吗
Can I smoke in here?

355
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,070
抽烟
Smoke?

356
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,800
等麦克利回来你再问他
Ask Macklay when he gets back.

357
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,250
抽烟对你有害
But smoking's bad for you.

358
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,810
我知道
I know.

359
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,890
"去你的  艾伯特"
"Fuck you, Albert."

360
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,940
没错
That's right.

361
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,490
去你的  艾伯特
Fuck you, Albert.

362
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,370
这些坐标代表什么地方
What place do those coordinates represent?

363
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,360
最后几位数字糊了
Well, the last few digits are smudged,

364
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,210
但这些数字指向北方的一个小镇
but the numbers indicate a small town in the north--

365
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,050
警察的美梦成真
The policeman's dream.

366
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,890
谢谢  麦克利警探
Thank you, Detective Macklay.

367
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,770
不客气
You're welcome.

368
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,670
我能在这抽烟吗
Hey, can I smoke in here?

369
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,100
不行  这里禁烟
No, there's no smoking allowed.

370
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,010
麦克利警探
Detective Macklay,

371
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,790
你知道香烟配上这咖啡会有多美味吗
you know how good a cigarette would taste with this coffee?

372
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,910
你有烟就抽吧
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

373
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,140
谢谢
Thank you.

374
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,150
所以
So...

375
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,810
附近并无可疑人物
...no suspects were found in the area.

376
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,780
身份已确认是露丝·达文波特
It's a positive ID on Ruth Davenport.

377
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,650
我想你们应该没找到布里格斯少校的头
I don't suppose you found Major Briggs' head anywhere.

378
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,590
我们找了
We looked.

379
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
毫无踪迹
There's no trace.

380
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,150
没有人听到声音  没有枪声
Nobody heard anything. No shots.

381
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,470
黑斯廷斯的死状不是子弹造成的
A bullet didn't do that to Hastings.

382
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,940
是的  他们仍在清洗车辆
Yeah, they're still cleaning the vehicle.

383
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,360
我们有看到人  我和艾伯特
We saw somebody, Albert and I,

384
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,860
就在我们发现露丝·达文波特尸体的地方后面
out back, out back where we found Ruth Davenport's body.

385
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,750
他长什么样子
What'd he look like?

386
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,950
像个流浪汉
He looked like a homeless man, uh...

387
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,830
衣服破旧  留胡子  戴毛帽
old clothes, beard, wool cap.

388
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,950
我好像有看到那样的人
I think I saw somebody like that

389
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,690
离开警车
getting out of the police car.

390
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,840
我有可能看错了
Uh, I-I could be mistaken.

391
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,600
我当时在车上
Well, I was in the car.

392
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,350
半个人影也没看到
I-I didn't see anybody.

393
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,040
我也没看到任何人
I didn't see anyone either.

394
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,770
我都说了我不确定了
Well, I-I said I wasn't sure.

395
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,500
我想起来了
Now I remember.

396
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,580
我见过他们...
I saw them...

397
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,540
在一个房间里
in a room.

398
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,930
我见过那群留胡子的人
I saw the bearded men,

399
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,000
跟我和艾伯特一起见过的一样
the same type Albert and I saw.

400
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,300
那间屋里的那群脏兮兮的留胡子的人
Dirty, bearded men in a room.

401
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,080
道吉  来我办公室一趟
Dougie, come into my office, please.

402
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,270
穆林斯先生  我是菲尔·拜斯比
Mr. Mullins, Phil Bisby here.

403
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,130
咖啡已经买好了  我们马上就到
I got your coffee and we'll be right in.

404
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,320
好的
Good.

405
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,250
穆林斯先生  这杯是您的咖啡
All right, Mr. Mullins, here's your coffee, sir.

406
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,160
-谢谢你  菲尔  -不客气
- Thank you, Phil. - You're welcome.

407
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,820
坐下吧  道吉
Sit down, Dougie.

408
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,050
你出去的时候
Just close the door behind you

409
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,150
顺便把门关上  菲尔
when you go, Phil.

410
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,070
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

411
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,960
道吉
Dougie,

412
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,110
我好好想了想这件事
now that I've had time to think about this,

413
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,250
你的调查结果显然已经
it's clear that your investigative work

414
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,420
揭露出了一系列的犯罪集团
has exposed a ring of organized crime

415
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,800
也有可能牵扯到这一届内部的
and possible police corruption

416
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,750
警察腐败问题
flowing through this office.

417
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,050
鉴于最近有两起企图谋杀你的案件
The recent two attempts on your life,

418
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,630
把你的车炸了  还有人想要射杀你
the blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you,

419
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,850
这已经很说明问题了
absolutely confirm this.

420
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,160
还有  多亏了你  我们才能知道
Also, thanks to you, we now know that

421
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,850
米彻姆兄弟的案子并不是一桩纵火案
the Mitchum brothers' case was not arson

422
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,340
而是想从火灾中要点索赔
but a legitimate claim for an accidental fire,

423
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,280
所以我觉得虽然米彻姆兄弟
which indicates to me that the Mitchum brothers,

424
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,610
是臭名昭著的黑帮成员
although alleged gangsters,

425
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,780
但这起阴谋却不是他们策划的
are not part of this conspiracy,

426
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,160
也就说明对你的袭击的策划者
which suggests that the shots are being called

427
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,200
另有其人
by somebody else.

428
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,110
另有其人
Somebody else.

429
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,210
你说得对  道吉
I think you're right, Dougie.

430
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,380
有意思的就是这点
And this is interesting.

431
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,250
米彻姆兄弟刚刚给我打电话
The Mitchums just called me,

432
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,450
说想约你当面谈一谈
wanting to have a personal sit-down with you.

433
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,000
一般情况下
Now, normally,

434
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,570
我绝对不会让我的探员
I wouldn't put one of my agents

435
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,570
去和那种人单打独斗
into the ring with guys like this,

436
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,630
可既然是你发现的
but since you uncovered

437
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,110
而且也替他们正了名
and righted the wrong on their behalf,

438
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,450
等他们拿到了你带去的
they are gonna be ecstatic

439
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,230
这张三千万的支票
when you deliver to them

440
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,320
肯定会高兴到乐上天的
this 30-million-dollar check.

441
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,810
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

442
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,360
你肯定在想"这张三千万的支票
You're thinking, "A 30-million-dollar payout

443
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,080
我们这种小公司怎么掏得起"  对吧
for a firm our size, that has to be catastrophic," Right?

444
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,360
确实掏不起
Catastrophic, right.

445
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,970
可拳击新星
But Battling Bud

446
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,140
永远要打比他强的对手
always punched above his weight class.

447
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,100
我还备了另一套方案
I took out a secondary policy

448
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,830
来掩盖我们这次行动
to cover our play on this one,

449
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,550
因为这个案子确实是个意外
which, because it was truly was an accident,

450
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,540
我们就能借此补偿损失  还能再捞一笔
will cover our potential loss and then some.

451
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,130
布什内尔双连击
Bushnell double down.

452
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,720
布什内尔双连击
Bushnell double down.

453
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,070
拳击新星是不会一直被吊打的
Nobody keeps Battling Bud on the ropes for long.

454
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,640
最强硬汉
布什内尔·拳击新星·穆林斯

455
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,530
他们要五点半见你
They want to see you at 5:30.

456
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,330
他们会派车来
They're sending a car.

457
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,450
他刚从浴室里出来
He's just coming out of the bathroom now.

458
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,400
好吧...
All right...

459
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,300
罗德尼

463
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,910
我梦见我要去杀那个混蛋道格拉斯·琼斯
I dreamt about killing that Douglas Jones fuck.

464
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,430
我实在是太恨他了
I just hate him so bad.

465
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,810
简直等不及想要杀了他
I can't wait to kill this guy.

466
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,580
你还能再等上三个小时吗
Can you last three more hours?

467
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,510
不一定
Barely.

468
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,670
我实在没胃口
I can't eat this.

469
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,320
道吉  已经五点半了  你要去哪
Dougie, it's 5:30. Where are you going?

470
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,660
你已经拿到支票了  不是吗
You've got the check, don't you?

471
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,600
是的  你都准备好了
Yeah, you're all set.

472
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,830
你要带他去哪里
Where you taking him?

473
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,810
圣蒂诺
Santino's.

474
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,690

你怎么了  布拉德利
What is with you, Bradley?

481
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,950
开心点
Be happy.

482
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,390
我们马上就要干掉一个
We're about to rid ourselves of an asshole

483
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,420
给我们捅了大大大篓子的家伙

484
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,100
他帮我们干掉了艾克穗
Well, he nailed Ike the Spike for us.

485
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,810
他不是为了我们

再说  他让我们损失了三千万

坎迪划伤你的伤痕
The cut Candie gave you.

499
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,560

那盒子里有东西

521
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,740
如果这是我在梦里看到的东西
And if that something is what I saw in my dream,

522
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,150
我们就不能杀他
we can't kill him.

523
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,630
你他妈在说...
What the fuck are you talking--

524
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,740
不  我没开玩笑  罗德尼
No, I'm not kidding, Rodney.

525
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:23,630
如果他箱子里装的
If he's got this one certain thing

526
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,620
是那个东西
that's in that box,

527
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,980
那说明我们不能杀他

528
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,180

你怎么知道
How the fuck can you know that?

531
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,680
我就是告诉你梦里的东西

什么
What?

534
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,090
罗德尼  虽然机会不大
Rodney, it's a million-in-one shot,

535
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,610
但如果的确在里面  你得...

我们不杀他
We won't kill him.

541
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,670
够了  到底是什么
Okay, enough. What is it?

542
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:12,580
好吧
All right.

543
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,300
搞什么
Okay. What the fuck?

544
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:18,950
盒子里
In the box there,

连我们该死的孤儿都有健身房
Even our fucking orphanage had a gym set.

563

564

给  哥们

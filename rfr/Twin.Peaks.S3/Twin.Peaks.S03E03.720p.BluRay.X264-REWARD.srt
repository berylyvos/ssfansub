Dougie, what is wrong with your arm?

29
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,160
我不知道
I don't know.

30
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,600
我觉得它睡着了
I think it fell asleep.

31
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,570
有点刺痛
It's sort of tingly.

32
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,260
我也有点刺痛
I'm kind of tingly, too.

33
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,310
我要去洗洗  好吗
I'm gonna go wash up, okay?

34
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,570
怎么回事
What the fuck was that?

35
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,070
道吉
Dougie!

37
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,360
我怎么了
What's happening to me?

38
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,730
有人

39
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,350
制造了

40
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,980
你

41
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,460
什么
What?

42
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,240
为了一个目的

43
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,030
但是

44
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,280
我认为

45
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,730
现在

46
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,800
那目的已经

47
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,520
实现了

48
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,650
是吗
It has?

49
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,320
真奇怪
That's weird.

50
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,540
那是什么声音  道吉
What was that noise, Dougie?

51
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,050
你在哪
Where are you?

52
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,510
道吉
Dougie?

53
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,050
我的天
Oh, my God.

54
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,890
道吉  搞什么
Dougie, what the hell?

55
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,350
你从哪弄的那西装...
Where'd you get that suit...

56
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,430
还有发型
and haircut?

57
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,470
难道你一直都戴着假发吗  道吉
Have you been wearing a rug all this time, Dougie?

58
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,210
天啊  你病了吗  道吉
Oh, my God, are you sick, Dougie?

59
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,100
快起来  我们得出门了
Come on, we got to get out of this house.

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,930
快点儿啊  道吉

道吉
Dougie.

62
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,630
道吉  你是不是忘了什么
Dougie, did you forget something?

63
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,160
你的鞋呢
Your shoes?

64
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,620
我去拿吧
I'll get them.

65
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,060
道吉
Dougie!

66
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,080
别闹了行吗
Could you quit fucking around?

67
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,490
把你的鞋穿上  给
And put on your shoes. Here.

68
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,510
把你鞋穿上

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,630
快点  我们走
Come on, let's go.

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,740
好吧
All right...

71
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,980
你带了钥匙吧
You do have your keys, right?

72
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,360
你是说杰德要捎你两程吗
You mean Jade has to give you two rides?

73
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,720
她刚开着一辆吉普牧马人走了
Yeah, she just drove by in a Wrangler.

74
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,960
看上去好像有两个人  但是...
Looked like maybe two people, but...

75
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,830
他的车还在这里

我在入口处准备就绪了

77
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,280
如果他在车里  我就把他带过来

78
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,570

80
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,810
公用电话  或是搞到点钱
a pay phone or some money,

81
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,860
你就打给拖车公司  道吉

82
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,300
他们会帮你的

87
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,660
基恩...

88

他不在车里

89
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,020
他肯定还在屋里
Yeah, he must still be inside.

90
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,920
我去给他的车装追踪器
I'll load up his car. -

91
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,720
好

97
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,780
怎么回事  比利
What the hell, Billy?

98
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,600
天啊  里面臭死了
Oh, God, something awful's in there.

99
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,610
调度中心
Dispatch.

100
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,400
我们需要一辆救护车
We need an ambulance.

101
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,070
让他们带上防毒面具
And tell them to bring gas masks.

102
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,660
车里的味道很难闻
There is something bad in this vehicle.

103
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,300
过来
Come here.

104
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,410
你不会有事的

105
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:38,570
双峰镇警察局

106
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,920
欢迎骚扰

107
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,750
我们把所有东西都摆出来了  霍克
We laid everything out, Hawk,

108
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,540
但没发现丢了的东西
and we can't find anything that's missing.

109
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,580
假如东西不在这里  那么...
If it's not here, then...

110
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,640
你怎么知道它不见了
how do you know it's missing?

111
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,590
但假如东西在这里...
But if it is here...

112
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,770
那就说明没有丢
then it isn't missing?

113
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,060
这个...
This...

114
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,920
是在这里的
is here.

115
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,280
让我们坐下吧
Let's sit down.

116
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,820
让...
Let--

117
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,320
我坐下吧
let me sit down.

118
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,720
让我们从头开始
Let's start from the beginning.

119
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,960
-而且...  -别说话
- And-- - Don't say a thing.

120
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,710
我得把我的想法说出来
I need to think out loud.

121
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,880
有东西不见了  我得把它找出来
Something is missing, and I need to find it.

122
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,720
而我找到它的方式
And the way I'm gonna find it

123
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,430
和我的遗产有关
has something to do with my heritage.

124
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,290
你是个印第安人
You're an Indian.

125
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,520
是的  露西
Yes, Lucy.

126
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,830
显然...
And apparently...

127
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,450
我就是要通过那种方式来弄明白不见的是什么
that's the way I'm gonna find what's missing.

128
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,820
小兔子巧克力

129
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,680
怎么了
What is it?

130
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,030
你还好吗  小甜甜
Are you okay, punky?

131
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,670
我知道什么东西不见了
I know what's missing!

132
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,110
什么
What's missing?

133
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,470
小兔子
The bunny!

134
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,070
小兔子
The bunny.

135
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,900
我吃了小兔子
I ate that bunny!

136
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,360
小兔子巧克力

137
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,430
不见的就是它
That's missing.

138
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,400
就是它不见了
That's missing.

139
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,530
小兔子巧克力
Do chocolate bunnies

140
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,200
跟你的遗产有任何关联吗
have anything to do with your heritage?

141
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,020
没有
No.

142
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,870
跟小兔子没关系
It's not about the bunny.

143
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,450
你把证据吃了  露西
You ate the evidence, Lucy?

144
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,760
我知道
I know!

145
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,420
那是唯一一次
I never did it again.

146
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,470
我也只吃了一个
And I only ate one.

147
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,670
我从没有再犯了
And I never did it again.

148
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,660
但我当时出了点毛病...
But I had a problem at that time with--

149
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,460
我也不想当着安迪面说
And I don't like to say this in front of Andy.

150
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,450
但我当时有一点
But I had a bubble...

151
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,390
胀气
of gas.

152
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,850
我听说
And I had read...

153
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,560
有时候我爱吃的
...that sometimes chocolate,

154
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,360
巧克力
which I love,

155
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,380
可以当作一种疗方
can be used as a remedy,

156

He claims he's innocent and knows who did it,

223
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,070

but can't say because it would breach national security.

224
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:43,810
不管怎么样

225

乔治敦花园中的东西

纽约警局不知道到底发生了什么

他们甚至不知道这地方是谁的
They don't even know who owns the place.

236

那里之前全天候24小时都有门卫看守
Apparently there were guards on duty 24-7,

237
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,630
但现在一个都不见了

238

只能确认死者山姆·科尔比
Only the victims-- Sam Colby, Tracey Barberato--

239
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,960

240
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,660
他们还收缴了还几百卷

241

从不同角度拍这个玻璃箱的录像

然后凶案发生当晚
Then on the night of the murders,

245
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,220
录像中出现了这个

246
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:46,470
什么东西
What the hell?

247
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,150
其他相机什么都没拍到
The other cameras saw nothing.

248
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,460
这个东西一动

249
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:54,960
就消失了
it disappeared.

250
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,460
法医怎么说

251
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,470
尸体被残忍肢解了
The bodies were violently mutilated,

252
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,940
但是没有留下任何指纹  DNA和纤维

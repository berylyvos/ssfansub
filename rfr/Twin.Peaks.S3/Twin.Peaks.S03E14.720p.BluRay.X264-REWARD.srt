你认为里面的是谁

都是旧事了  查德
It's all old business, Chad,

35

早在你之前了

36
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,010
你们要去哪

去山上
Up the mountain.

你被捕了  查德

39
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,670
搞什么

40
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,370
怎么回事
What's this all about?

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,050
你应该知道的

安迪  博比
Andy, Bobby,

43

带他去楼下

44
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,700
你在犯一个天大的错误
You're making a big mistake!

45
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,290
你犯了错  查德
You made the mistake, Chad.

46

我们已经监视了你好几个月

收走他的警徽  把他关起来

49

闭嘴

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,170
这是你的烤牛肉和芝士

51
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,990
博比
Bobby.

52
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,970
我们现在走的这里以前是有路的
This used to be the road, where we're walking.

53
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,850
我爸以前的监听站就从这里穿过去

全都搬走了
Took everything away.

56
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,630
你父亲以前在那是做什么的  博比
And what all did your father do up there, Bobby?

57
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,200
我不知道
I don't know.

58
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,110
全都是高度机密
It was all top secret.

59
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,280
我小的时候  他带我进去过几次
Took me inside a couple times when I was little,

60
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,890
但我只记得
but all I remember is

61
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,150
里面有很多很多机器
lots and lots of machines.

62
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,170
但是他还是会带我来
He would take me here, though.

63
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,000
等等
Just a sec.

64
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,690
就是这个
This is it,

65

《杰克兔子宫殿》
Jackrabbit's Palace.

66
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,660
以前我们会坐在这
You know, we'd sit here and-and...

67
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,730
编一些荒诞的故事
make up great tall tales.

68
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,000
这里向东走大约231米
Two hundred and fifty-three yards due east.

69
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,780
我们得在口袋里放点土
And we have to put some soil in our pockets.

70
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,670
但愿这不是父亲的其中一个荒诞故事
Let's hope this is not one of your father's tall tales.

71
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,330
我也希望不是
I hope so too.

72
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,050
我觉得不是
I don't think so.

73
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,120
我们很快就会知道
We'll soon find out.

74
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,400
父亲的确和我说过
Father did tell me

75
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,280
没有他的陪同下  不要在这里徘徊
never wander around here without him.

76
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,440
走吧
Let's go.

77
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,350
她还活着
She's alive.

78
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,420
两点53分  各位
It's 2:53, fellas.

79
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,210

我们要把她救下山

83
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,020
她非常地重要
She's very important,

84
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,190
而且有人想杀死她
and there are people that want her dead.

85
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,660
她的身体没事
She's fine physically.

86
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,900
我们要把她放进小屋里  她就会安全了
We need to put her in a cell where she'll be safe.

87
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,390
好

88
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,540
这事别告诉任何人
Don't tell anybody about this.

89
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,130
刚才我们在那里发生了什么事
What happened to us back there?

90
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,320
我不知道
I don't know.

91
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,900

Something.

92
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,750
但是我完全不记得了

但愿这睡衣合身
I hope these pajamas are okay.

96
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,640
自从那次那只狗在这失踪后
They've been in my locker

97
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,910
这睡衣一直放在我的柜子里

睡衣很漂亮  露西

你是大坏人  查德
You're a very bad person, Chad.

107
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,450
让好警察蒙上了坏名声
Give good policemen a bad name.

108
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,130
好警察坏名声
Good policemen a bad name.

109
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,330
闭嘴  你个烂醉鬼
Shut up, you fucking drunk!

110
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,890
闭嘴  你个烂醉鬼
Shut up, you fucking drunk!

111

112
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,100
闭嘴
Shut up!

113
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,900
你他妈有什么毛病
What the fuck is wrong with you?

114
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,750
你他妈有什么毛病

简直是一群神经病
Fucking nuthouse.

117
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,330
我最好这么做
I better do that.

118
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,760
这些板条箱你要我怎么处理
What'd you want me to do with the crates?

119
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,140
就留在那吧
Just leave them.

120
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,020
我明早会盖上布
I'll throw the linens on them in the morning.

121
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,190
那样他们比较方便

122
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,720
来
There you go.

123
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,910
别紧张
Take it easy.

124
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,680
我们没事的
We're cool.

再送一趟货
We got one more delivery,

127
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,930
咱们就去酒馆
and then it's hit the Roadhouse.

128
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,080
今天谁演唱

129
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,030
不知道
Don't know.

130
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,470
你想去看蕾妮在不在
You want to see if Renee will be there.

131
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,260
可能吧
Yeah, maybe.

132
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,730
但她是有夫之妇
But she's married.

133
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,490
我知道
I know.

134
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,730
你多大了  弗莱迪

137
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,460
今天是我生日

138
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,470

这可是大事
This is a real occasion.

141
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,500
你是真的不能脱下那玩意是吧
So you really can't take that thing off, huh?

142
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,320
没办法
Nah, I can't.

143
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,240
我不明白
I don't understand.

144
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,840
这是我身体的一部分
It's, uh, part of me.

145
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,330
医生曾经尝试将它拿下来  结果...
Doctor tried to take it off once, and...

146
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,720
我就流血了
I started bleeding.

147
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,650
你从哪弄来的
Where'd you get it?

148
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,170
这我不能说
I'm, uh, not supposed to tell.

149
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,670
今天我生日  弗莱迪  你得告诉我
It's my birthday, Freddie. You gotta tell me.

150
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,850
我不会说出去的
Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

151
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,100
反正讲了你也不会相信
Eh, you ain't gonna believe me anyway.

152
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,780
所以你可以告诉我啊
So you may as well tell me.

153
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,750
弗莱迪  拜托嘛  告诉我
Freddie, come on, tell me the story.

154
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,650
拜托了
Come on.

155
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,880
这个嘛
Well...

156
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,230
我都告诉医生了
I told the doctor.

157
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,660
应该也可以告诉你吧
I, uh--I guess I can tell you.

158
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,070
看在今天是你生日的份上
And seeing as how it's your birthday.

159
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,050
当时我还住在家里
I was still living at home, see?

160
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,240
那是哪里
Where was that?

161
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,150
东边的伦敦镇
That would be London Town, East End.

162
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,120
大概六个月前
About six months ago,

163
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,910
某一晚  跟我的伙计们去完夜店后
after a night down at the pub with me mates,

164
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,780
我独自走回家
I'm walking home alone.

165
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,840
我抄捷径转入小巷时
I get this peculiar feeling

166
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,640
突然有股莫名奇妙的感觉
as I turn into this alley I use as a shortcut.

167
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,690
我恍然大悟我是在浪费生命  吉米
It strikes me that I'm wasting me life, Jimmy.

168
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,730
四处游荡
Hanging about,

169
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,090
夜夜流连夜店  饮酒作乐
hitting the pub every night, drinking,

170
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,190
我应该要帮助其他人的
when I should be helping people.

171
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,350
就在那一晚我有了这种感受
With this feeling in me on this particular night,

172
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,870
而我在小巷里看见高高的一堆箱子
I see in the alleyway a high stack of boxes,

173
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,220
我就跳进去
and I jumped,

174
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,990
就图个好玩
you know, like, for fun.

175
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,800
我跳进箱子堆
I jumped onto this high stack of boxes.

176
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,920
突然之间
And all of a sudden,

177
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,260
我被吸进了空中的巨大的漩涡隧道
I was sucked up into the vortex of this massive tunnel in the air.

178
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,760
接着我发觉
Next thing you know,

179
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,630
我已经浮在半空中
I'm floating in thin air,

180
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,050
某处的空中
way up somewhere,

181
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,700
如同虚空
like a void.

182
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,660
有个伙计在那儿
And this bloke's there.

183
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,720
他自称"消防员"
The Fireman's what he's called himself.

184
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,510
他对我说
And he says to me,

185
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,750
"去你公寓附近的五金店
"Go to the hardware store near your flat.

186
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,720
你会找到一排绿色的园艺用手套
And there you will find a rack of green rubber gardening gloves.

187
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,620
其中有一包已经开封
One package will already be open,

188
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,220
里面只有一只右手的手套
with only a right-handed glove inside.

189
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,470
买下那一包
Purchase that package

190
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,840
将手套戴在你的右手
and place the glove on your right hand.

191
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,240
你的右手就会拥有打桩机一般的
Your right hand will then possess the power

192
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,790
巨大力量"
of an enormous pile driver."

193
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,120
砰一声
Poof.

194
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,630
我回到了我的房间
And I'm back in me room,

195
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,570
醒来已是隔天早上
waking up the next morning.

196
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,610
我起身下床
I got up, got out of bed.

197
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,300
梳头发
Dragged a comb across me head.

198
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,480
下楼  喝了一杯
And I went downstairs and had a cup.

199
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,050
不  这些是玩笑话
No. Just kidding about that part.

200
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,120
于是我去了转角的五金店
So I pop round the corner to the hardware store,

201
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,740
找到那一排手套
find the rack of gloves.

202
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,320
想当然
And, sure enough,

203
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,880
有一包已开封的手套  里面只剩右手
there's the open package with the one right hand.

204
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,990
我走去柜台
Off I go to the counter,

205
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,460
拿商品给店员结账
lay down the package for the clerk,

206
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,000
他说
and he says,

207
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,610
"我不能卖你这一副
"I can't sell you that one.

208
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,890
你得购买未开封的"
You have to buy one that hasn't been opened."

209
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,120
我说  "没事  我就要这副"
So I say, "That's all right. I want this one."

210
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,040
他说  "我不能卖你这一副"
He says, "I can't sell you that one."

211
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,960
我说  "听着  伙计
I says, "Listen, mate.

212
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,840
我只想买单只手套
I want to buy just the one glove,

213
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,740
我会付你一副的钱"
and I will pay you full price."

214
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,570
"不行  这袋已经开封
"No, it's already been opened.

215
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,510
我不能卖给你"
I can't sell it to ya."

216
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,310
在我老家呢
Now, where I come from,

217
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,200
我们管这种傻逼叫"死脑筋"
we call a bloke like this a "Jobsworth."

218
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,320
这种人喜欢
That is a person who delights in acting

219
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,260
阻挠别人或是拒绝配合
in an obstructive or otherwise unhelpful manner,

220
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,480
说什么"这我办不到
as in, "I can't do that.

221
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,620
超出我的工作权限了"
It's more than my job's worth."

222
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,120
所以我和死脑筋先生说
So I says to Mr. Jobsworth,

223
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,910
"听着  我要买这个手套"
"Listen, I'm buying this glove."

224
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,920
我就把我的钱放在柜台上往门外走
And I put me bees on the counter and walk towards the door.

225
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,420
死脑筋追在我后面  像一只猎豹
Well, Jobsworth leaps after me like a possessed puma,

226
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,820
大喊着我不能买已经开封的
screaming that I can't have the glove from the package

227
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,600
包裹中的手套
which has already been opened.

228
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,610
我冲出门  跑到路上
I bolt out the door, hit the cobbles,

229
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,190
想把死脑筋先生甩在身后
hoping to leave Mr. Jobsworth in the dust,

230
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,310
一边跑一边把手套戴在了手上
slipping the glove on while I go.

231
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,550
于是我的脚步稍微放缓了
Then he slows me down a mite.

232
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,410
然后突然间
And before you know it,

233
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,980
死脑筋先生猛地绊了我一下
Jobsworth puts a tackle on me worthy of a red card

234
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,000
我狠狠地摔在地上
and sends me skidding on the field.

235
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,830
我下意识地自卫
On instinct, to defend myself,

236
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,910
用我戴着绿手套的手揍了他一拳
I popped Jobsworth one in the loaf with me green glove.

237
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,830
我听到一声脆响  然后...
I hear a crack, and...

238
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,400
他的脑袋歪在一边  仿佛想说点什么
by the way his head's tilting and him trying to talk...

239
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,680
我怕我打断了他的脖子
...I fear I've snapped his Gregory.

240
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,960
然后
And then,

241
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,970
那一瞬间
in that moment,

242
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,690
我记起来那个飘在空中的东西还和我说过
I remember something else that bloke up in the sky told me.

243
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,680
"你戴上手套后
"Once you've got the glove on,

244
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,570
就去美国
go to Twin Peaks, Washington,

245
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,360
华盛顿州的双峰镇
United States of America.

246
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,290
在那里
And there,

247
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,540
你会找到你的命运"
you will find your destiny."

248
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,180
所以我就来了  吉米
So here I am, Jimmy,

249
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,300
在你的生日
on your birthday.

250
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,800
祝你长命百岁
Many happy returns.

251
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,450
谢谢你  弗莱迪  这个故事很不错
Thank you, Freddie. That's a great story.

252
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,390
不客气  先生
The pleasure's all mine, sir.

253
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,220
为什么选中你
Why you?

254
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,470
我是说你觉得消防员为什么选中你
I mean, why do you think the Fireman picked you?

255
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,150
这个问题不错
Well, that's a good question.

256
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,330
我也问过我自己  我说
I asked him myself, I said,

257
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,410
"为什么是我"
"Why me?"

258
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,100
他说
And he said,

259
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,720
"为什么不能是你"
"Why not you?"

260
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,230
然后我就去买机票飞到这里
And when I went to buy me ticket to fly over here,

261
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,780
他们告诉我我已经有机票了
they told me I already had a ticket.

262
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,440
别忘了
Don't forget.

263
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,580
我们得去检查锅炉
We're supposed to check the furnace.

264
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,470
嗯  你在这里等货
Yeah. You wait for the delivery.

265
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,800
别忘了在发票上签名
Don't forget to sign the invoice.

266
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,740
我去检查锅炉
I'm gonna go check the furnaces.

267
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:29,630
麋鹿九点酒吧

268
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,030
一杯血腥玛丽
Bloody Mary.

269
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,450
马上来
Coming up.

270
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,130
谢谢
Thanks.

271
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,390
你今晚一人独饮吗
You drinking all alone tonight?

272
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,300
别多管闲事
Mind your own business,

273
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,110
谢谢
please.

274
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,890
这样说可不礼貌
That's not very polite.

275
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,480
我本来就没打算有礼貌
It wasn't meant to be polite.

276
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,390
你能坐回
Would you sit back

277
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,670
你原来的位置吗
where you were,

278
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,730
谢谢
please?

279
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,990
我想做哪儿就坐哪儿
I'll sit wherever I want.

280
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,740
这是个自由的国家
It's a free country.

281
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,710
这是个自由的国家
It's a free country.

282
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,120
这是个自由的国妓啊
It's a free cunt-ry.

283
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,250
也许你是个女同
Maybe you're one of them bull dykes.

284
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,880
没错
Yeah.

285
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,700
我想了想
Come to think of it,

286
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,940
你看上去的确像女同性恋
you look kind of like a bull dyke lesbo.

287
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,530
你喜欢吃逼  是吧
You like to eat cunt, huh?

288
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,900
我会吃你
I'll eat you.

289
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,830
什么
What?

290
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,110
做梦去吧  你这贱人
Like hell you will, you miserable bitch.

291
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,800
我会把你这对同性恋奶子扯下来
I'll fucking pull your little lesbo titties off.

292
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,440
你真的想来挑事情吗
Do you really want to fuck with this?

293
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,190
搞什么  怎么回事
What the hell? What happened?

294
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,440
他突然倒下了  我不知道
He just fell over. I don't know.

295
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,500
怎么回事  他大半个脖子不见了
What, with half his neck missing?

296
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,740
该死
Damn.

297
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,850
这跟你有关系吗
You have something to do with this?

298
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,950
什么  你都看到我了
What? You-you saw me.

299
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,240
我就坐在这里喝酒
I was just sitting here, having my drink.

300
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,290
亲爱的
Honey!

301
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,260
快报警
Call 911!

302
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,690
酒吧里死人了
We got a dead one at the bar.

303
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,350
等警察来了再说
We'll see about this.

304
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,720
是啊
Yeah.

305
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,050
这真是个谜
Sure is a mystery, huh?

306
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,130
枪炮酒吧

307
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,840
那是因为你一直在精神病院里
That's because you're hanging out at the nuthouse.

308
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,410
我没有
I'm not.

309
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,090
在那里嗑嗨了
Getting high in there.

310
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,720
胡说  我没有
Bullshit. I'm not.

311
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,680
我在自己房间嗑嗨了
I'm getting high in my room.

312
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,700
在我自己房间里上天
Flying in my own room.

313
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,380
别去那个疯狂的地方
Just don't go in that nut place.

314
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,570
去你的  谁说我会去
Fuck you. Who said I would anyway?

315
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,950
毛衣不错
Nice sweater.

316
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,940
从哪儿偷来的
Where'd you lift that?

317
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,580
那是宝拉的
It's Paula's.

318
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,220
很不错
It's nice.

319
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,390
你最近见过比利吗
Have you seen Billy?

320
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,050
没有  好几天没见过了
No, not for a couple of days.

321
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,980
听说你是最后一个见到比利的人
I heard you were the last person to see Billy.

322
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,540
太可怕了
It was so fucking scary.

323
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,200
他当时跟我和我妈妈一起在厨房里
He was in the kitchen with me and my mom.

324
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,460
我叔叔应该也在
Think my uncle was there.

325
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,630
我不确定
I'm not sure, um...

326
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:37,160
然后我们看到比利在窗外
You know, at the window, we see Billy.

327
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,380
他跳过了篱笆  两米高的篱笆
He's jumped over a fence, a six-foot fence,

328
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,020
跳到我们的后院
lands in our backyard.

329
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,710
然后跟疯了似的冲向后门
He comes running like crazy to the back door.

330
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,720
我确定他从窗户里看到了我
And I can tell he sees me through the window.

331
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,660
他的眼神很奇怪
And he had this look in his eyes.

332
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,220
他撞开了后门
Comes slamming in the back,

333
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,890
闯进了厨房
stumbles in the kitchen.

334
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,310
我开始尖叫  我觉得我妈妈也在尖叫
I start screaming, and I think my mom screamed too.

335
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,770
他的鼻子和嘴巴都在往外冒鲜血
And there was blood coming out his nose and mouth.

336
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,590
然后他就把自己的脑袋伸进水槽里
And he goes and hangs his head in the sink.

337
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,570
血和瀑布一样流下来
Blood's just gushing like a waterfall.

338
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,400
他转头看向我们
And he turns and looks at us,

339
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,130
眼神很奇怪  全都是血
real strange and all bloody.

340
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,420
然后他又从后门冲了出去
And then he bolts out the back again.

341
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,640
我们一脸"怎么回事"
We're like, "What?"

342
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,170
你没有告诉过任何人吗
And you didn't tell anyone?

343
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,310
我们...我们不知道该怎么办
We-we just didn't know what to do.

344
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,850
我们不知道他到底怎么了
I mean, we didn't know what the hell was going on with him.

345
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,680
我知道我妈妈和他有一腿
And I know my mom and him had a thing.

346
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,100
什么  真的吗
What? Really?

347
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,110
是的
Yeah.

348
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,600
至少最近还有关系
Up until pretty recent, at least.

349
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,980
我是说我经常能听到风言风语
I mean, I just caught wind of it from time to time.

350
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,230
每次提到他的名字  都会露出意味深长的微笑
The smile in her face whenever his name came up.

351
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,280
你妈妈叫什么
What's your mom's name?

352
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,570
蒂娜
It's Tina.

353
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,110
他就这么又跑了出去
Then he just ran out again?

354
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,280
是啊  就像
Yeah, just, like,

355
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:08,150
他就在我们厨房待了十几秒
he was in our kitchen for maybe, like, ten seconds,

356
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,330
然后他就跑了  很快  很疯狂
and then he just took off, real fast and crazy.

357
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,780
然后  我们看到地上全是血
And after, we see all the blood on the floor

358
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,560
墙上也有一些
and some on the wall.

359
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,570
我和我妈妈花了好久
Took a while to clean it up,

360
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,230
才清理干净
me and my mom.

361
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,480
我记不清我叔叔在不在了
I don't remember if my uncle was there.

362
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:46,490
女士们先生们  欢迎丽斯上台表演

杰瑞
Jerry?

杰瑞
Jerry?

22
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,410
-杰瑞  怎么了  -有人偷了我的车
- Jerry, what's going on? - Someone stole my car.

23
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,640
什么
What?

24
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,280
我没告诉你吗
Didn't I tell you?

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,530
杰瑞  怎么了
Jerry, what's going on?

26
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,080
有人偷了你的车吗
Someone stole your car?

27
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,030
你说的是同一件事吗
You say the same thing?

28
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,730
什么
What?

29
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,930
杰瑞
Jerry.

30
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,430
我觉得我嗑多药了
I think I'm high!

31
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,800
老天啊  杰瑞
Oh, good Lord, Jerry.

32
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,440
我不知道自己在哪里
I don't know where I am!

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,970
双峰镇警察局

34
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,440
这就是我找到的东西
This is what I found.

35
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,180
-是劳拉·帕尔默的吗  -是的
- From Laura Palmer? - Yeah.

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,800
"这是我昨晚的梦
"This came to me in a dream last night.

37
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,750
我叫安妮
My name is Annie.

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,740
我和戴尔和劳拉在一起
I've been with Dale and Laura.

39
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,320
好戴尔在小屋中
The good Dale is in the lodge,

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,530
他出不来
and he can't leave.

41
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,750
写在你的日记中"
Write it in your diary." Unquote.

42
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,410
这个"戴尔"就是指戴尔·库柏特工吗
"Dale" As in Special Agent Dale Cooper?

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,540
对
Right.

44
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,840
你觉得这是什么意思
What do you think this means?

45
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,970
不知道  但我肯定
I don't know, but I'm sure

46
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,030
这就是木头女士希望我找到的东西
this is what the Log Lady wanted me to find.

47
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,650
我觉得这个"安妮"就是安妮·布莱克本
I think that "Annie" is Annie Blackburn, a...

48
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,050
一个去过那里的女孩
a girl that went into that place.

49
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,740
你肯定这些是来自劳拉的日记吗
And these pages are for sure from Laura's diary?

50
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,290
是的  这些是她日记里面的
Yeah, these are from her diary,

51
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,380
那本在他朋友哈罗德·史密斯那里的日记
the diary found at her friend Harold Smith's.

52
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,450
这些就是之前被撕掉的四页日记的
These are three of the four pages that we saw

53
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,050
其中三页  之前一直不知去向
were torn out, missing.

54
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,110
还有一页没有找到
And there's... There's still one missing.

55
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,710
你觉得这些是怎么到这里来的
And how do you think they got here,

56
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,230
藏在我们的厕所门中
inside our bathroom stall door?

57
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,810
不知道  但你看看这个
I'm not sure, but look at this.

58
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,530
"现在是凌晨一点半
"It's 1:30 A.M.

59
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,580
我哭得很凶  几乎喘不过气来
I'm crying so hard, I can hardly breathe.

60
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,180
现在我知道那不是鲍勃
Now I know it isn't Bob.

61
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,830
我知道那是谁了"
I know who it is."

62
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,120
我很肯定是利兰把这几页藏起来了
I'm sure it was Leland who hid these pages.

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,680
他看到了这些日记  发现她已经知道了
He found 'em and realized that she knew.

64
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,500
我记得这个
Well, I remember this.

65
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,690
利兰·帕尔默  她父亲
Leland Palmer, her father.

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,640
你觉得他是什么时候把这些藏在这里的
When do you think he hid these?

67
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,030
不知道
I don't know.

68
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,160
利兰来过警局好几次
Leland came into the station several times.

69
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,830
就在那阵子
Once around that time,

70
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,640
我们把他带进来询问
we brought him in for the questioning

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,540
关于谋杀雅克·雷诺的凶手的事
of the murder of Jacques Renault.

72
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,970
也许他以为我们会给他搜身
Maybe he thought we were gonna frisk him,

73
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,480
所以他就把日记藏了起来
and that's when he hid 'em.

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
劳拉从没有见过库柏
Laura never met Cooper.

75
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,690
他是她死后才来的  对吗
He came here after she died, didn't he?

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,180
她说安妮是在梦中对她说了这些话的
She said that these words from Annie came to her in a dream.

77
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,410
她说的话...
This thing she said...

78
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,760
"好戴尔在小屋中
"The good Dale is in the lodge

79
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
他出不来"
and can't come out."

80
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,470
但是那晚哈里看见库柏
But Harry saw Cooper

81
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,010
和安妮一起从小屋出来了
come out of the lodge with Annie that night.

82
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,700
医生和哈里带他去了大北方酒店
Doc and Harry took him over to the Great Northern,

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,010
但如果好库柏在小屋里
but if the good Cooper is in the lodge

84
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,660
出不来
and can't come out,

85
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,980
那和安妮走出小屋的
then the one who came out of the lodge with Annie that night...

86
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,290
就不是好库柏
was not the good Cooper.

87
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,120
而且之后他很快就离开了镇里
And he left town soon after.

88
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
那天还有谁看见他了
Who else saw him that day?

89
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,550
我说了  还有海沃德医生
Well, like I said, Doc Hayward,

90
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,330
还有没有其他人我就不知道了
but I don't know who else.

91
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,040
那我们跟哈里讲一下最新情况
Let's bring Harry up to speed,

92
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,650
看看他怎么想
see what he thinks.

93
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,220
能让他接一下电话吗
Can you get him for me?

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,660
我很乐意等着
I'd be happy to wait.

95
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,300
哈里
Harry.

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,810
他们把你弄到哪去了
Where the hell they got ya?

97
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,540
不是吧
Oh, no kidding.

98
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,970
该死
Damn.

99
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,980
很遗憾  哈里
I'm sorry, Harry.

100
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,850
我就是想跟你谈谈几件事情
Uh, just wanted to talk to you about a few things.

101
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,960
对
Oh. Right.

102
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,580
我...  休息吧
W... Get some rest.

103
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,070
我一会儿再打来
I'll check in later.

104
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,510
不是  没什么要紧的事
No, nothing urgent.

105
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,250
别担心
Don't worry about it.

106
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,660
好好休息
Just get rest, and...

107
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,940
还有  哈里  帮我个忙
and, Harry, do me a favor.

108
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,110
战胜它
Beat this thing.

109
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,990
好了  哥哥
All right, brother.

110
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,780

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,080
-但这就是你的卡车  -我知道这是我的车
- But that's your truck. - I know it's my truck.

112
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,660
我不能在这里跟你谈这个
I can't talk to you about this here.

113
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,840
我告过你了  请走吧
I told you. Please go away.

114
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,200
但如果刚才不是你在开  我得知道是谁
But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was.

115
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
我会告诉你的  把事情原原本本地告诉你
I'll tell you. I'll tell you the whole story.

116
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,460
我们找个别的地方
I'll meet you somewhere,

117
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,000
但我不能在这里跟你谈这个
but I can't talk to you here.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,970
求你了  你快带我离开这里
Please, you've got to get out of here now.

119
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,690
在斯帕克伍德21前的伐木路
The logging road above Sparkwood and 21.

120
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,830
靠近琼斯家吗

121
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,490
过了琼斯家  小溪边上
Just past Jones', down by the creek.

122

126
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,720

P-please leave. Please leave now.

127
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:57,280
杜鲁门警长

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,060
是你吗  医生
Is that you, Doc?

129

很高兴听到你的声音
Good to hear your voice.

131

哈里在哪
Where's Harry?

132
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,970
哈里这几天身体有些不适
Harry's, uh, a little under the weather these days.

133
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,940
是吗  祝他一切都好
Yeah? Well, give my best to him.

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,400
你知道网络电话是什么吗  医生
Uh, do you know what Skype is, Doc?

135
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,280
我一直都在用
I use it all the time.

136
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,820
有一天  我给穆勒太太看湿疹
Just the other day, I diagnosed Mrs. Mueller's eczema.

137
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,020
都不用离开自己的椅子
Never had to get out of my chair.

138
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,890
你的网络电话昵称是什么  医生
What's your Skype handle, Doc?

139
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,690
我也建一个
I'll, uh, saddle up.

140
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,620
米德伯理医生

看到你了  医生
There you are, Doc.

144
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,160
什么事
What's this all about?

145
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,570
医生  你还记得很久之前
Doc, do you remember way back when,

146
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,420
哈里叫你去
the night Harry called you in

147
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,210
大北方酒店
to examine Special Agent Dale Cooper

148
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,840
检查戴尔· 库柏特工的身体
at the Great Northern?

149
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,780
我不记得今天早餐吃了什么
I can't remember what I had for breakfast this morning,

150
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,630
但我不会忘记那事
but I remember that.

151
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,940
告诉我你还记得些什么内容
Tell me what you remember.

152
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,530
我们都了解阿库
Well, we all knew Coop,

153
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,560
可是他那天表现得非常...
but that morning he was acting mighty...

154
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,500
奇怪
strange.

155
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,810
然后呢
And?

156
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,170
我带他去医院
I took him to the hospital,

157
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,860
他检查的时候我就在附近转转
and I had him checked out while I made my rounds.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,860
大概一个小时之后
About an hour later,

159
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,590
我看到他穿着整齐
I saw him sneaking out of intensive care,

160
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,030
偷偷地从重症病房里溜出来
fully dressed.

161
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,780
他...他转身  然后
He... he turned, and...

162
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,140
然后他看到了我  接着
And he looked at me, and...

163
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,270
我又看到了他那副奇怪的表情
I saw that strange face again.

164
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,640
我大声叫他
I called out to him,

165
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,820
可是他没有理我
but he didn't say a word.

166
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,890
他转身就走了
He just turned around and walked out.

167
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,350
他在重症病房里做什么
What was he doing in intensive care?

168
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,310
我...我想了一下
I-I thought at the time

169
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,450
他可能顺路探望奥黛丽·霍恩
he might have been looking in on Audrey Horne.

170
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,620
银行发生那可怕的事
That terrible business at the bank, and...

171
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,810
她那时处于昏迷状态
She was in a coma.

172
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,380
身体怎么样  医生
How they biting back there, Doc?

173
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,610
有天早晨
You know, just the other morning,

174
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,220
我在睡衣里抓到了两天棕鳟
I caught two brown trout in my pajamas.

175
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,600
是吗
Yeah?

176
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,730
它们是怎样进到我睡衣里的
How they got in my pajamas,

177
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,780
我...我真不知道
I'll... I'll never know.

178
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,810
那你煮了它们当早餐吗
Did you make a breakfast out of them?

179
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,240
在河边用平底锅把它们煎了
Panfried 'em right out there by the river.

180
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,460
我还做了些炒鸡蛋
I had some scrambled eggs and...

181
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,280
还有一个英格兰松饼配越橘莓酱
and an English muffin with huckleberry jam.

182
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,130
不错
Yeah.

183
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,570
很高兴能跟你聊天  医生
Mighty good talking to you, Doc.

184
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,750
我会帮你向哈里问好的
I'll give your good wishes to Harry.

185
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,600
不论怎样
Whatever this is about,

186
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,860
我希望你能一切顺利
well, I hope it turns out all right for you.

187
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,930
继续您河边的工作吧  博士
Keep working the sunny side of the river, Doc.

188
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,560
再见  弗兰克
So long, Frank.

189
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,190
麦克利警探
Detective Macklay?

190
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,360
我是诺克斯中尉
I'm Lieutenant Knox.

191
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,060
你好  中尉
Oh, yes, Lieutenant.

192
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,240
很高兴见到你
It's good to meet you.

193
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,970
警探  感谢你的接见
Detective. Thanks for seeing me.

194
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,430
这不会花费太多时间
This shouldn't take long.

195
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,870
你前几天
You submitted a set of fingerprints

196
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,720
提交了一组指纹到我们的数据库
a few days ago to our database,

197
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,460
我们需要核实一下
and we need to verify the source.

198
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,140
我可以带你去看看
Well, I can show them to you,

199
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,780
我们的调查受到了阻碍
but our search was blocked.

200
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,570
希望能从你这里得到些头绪
That must have been from your end?

201
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,510
请带我去看看这些指纹
I'd like to see the prints, please.

202
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,510
你们从哪里收集到这组指纹的  犯罪现场吗
Where did you lift them from... A crime scene?

203
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,260
不是
No.

204
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,270
从一具尸体上收集的
Off the body.

205
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,340
还有尸体
There's a body?

206
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,440
是的  有一具尸体
There's a body, all right.

207
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,230
他的头去哪了
Where's the rest of him?

208
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,000
我们也不知道
We don't know.

209
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,160
这位先生多少岁
How old was this man?

210
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,370
快五十
Late 40s.

211
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,310
他是什么时候死的
When did this man die?

212
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,440
死了五六天吧
Within the last five or six days.

213
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,800
你们确定
You're sure this is the body

214
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,500
指纹是从这尸体上收集到的吗
you took those prints from?

215
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,490
没错
Yeah.

216
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,940
如果你喜欢的话  我可以再提取一次
I'm happy to pull 'em again for you, if you like.

217
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,960
如果知道了这是谁
It would sure help our investigation

218
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,860
对我们的调查肯定有很大的帮助
to know who this is.

219
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,900
先失陪一下
Excuse me for a moment.

220
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,610
长官  我是诺克斯中尉  长官
Sir. Lieutenant Knox, sir.

221
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,120
这次不单只是指纹
It's not just prints this time.

222
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,050
是一具尸体
It's a body.

223
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:14,630
戴维斯上校

224
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,660
是他
It's him.

225
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,310
你确定吗
You're sure?

226
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,030
指纹是从这具尸体上来的
The prints came off this body.

227
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,960
好的
Okay.

228
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,470
好了  我现在要打个电话
Okay. I have to make that other call.

229
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,090
还有一件事  长官
There's just one thing, sir.

230
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,540
什么事
What's that?

231
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,450
实际上  两件事才对
Actually, two things.

232
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,690
尸体的头不见了
The head is missing.

233
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,560
而且年龄也不对
And he's the wrong age.

234
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,720
你这是什么意思  辛迪
What do you mean, Cindy?

235
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,750
我的意思是
What I mean

236
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,110
他的头不在这里
is that his head is not here.

237
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,220
头不见了
It's missing,

238
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,450
还有那尸体显示
and the body

239
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,390
这是一名接近五十岁的男性
is that of a man in his late 40s

240
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,220
死亡时间是前几天
who died a few days ago.

241
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,970
如果他是最近死的
If he died recently,

242
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,770
布里格斯少校应该是七十多岁
Major Briggs should be in his 70s.

243
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,610
这中间肯定有什么不对
There must be some mistake.

244
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,060
我亲眼看过那具尸体
I've seen the body myself.

245
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,230
验尸官验证了年龄还有指纹
Coroner verified the age and the prints.

246
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,040
你先留在那里
Stay there.

247
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,730
我晚点再联系你
I'll get back to you.

248
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,560
我现在先打个电话
I'm making that other call now.

249
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,270
收到  长官
Yes, sir.

250
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,270
不允许其他人接近这尸体
No one else gets access to this body.

251
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,690
你介意跟我们说一下情况吗
You care to share any of this with us?

252
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,790
并不是由我来说...
You didn't hear it from me...

253
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,510
我想这案子
but I don't think this is going to be your investigation

254
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,450
很快就要交给上级调查
for too much longer.

255
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,240
谁
Yes?

256
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,570
请进
Come in.

257
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,290
事情办得怎么样了
How did it go?

258
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,150
不太顺利
Not well.

259
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,060
我说"你好  戴安"
I said, "Hello, Diane."

260
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,860
她回答说"要问库柏的事  对吗"
She said, "This is about Cooper, isn't it?"

261
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,060
我说"可能是"
I said, "Maybe."

262
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,640
她回答说  我只是复述她原话
She said, and I quote,

263
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,340
"他妈门都没有"
"No fucking way."

264
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,590
然后我就回家了
I was at home, dripping wet,

265
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,480
浑身湿透  十五分钟后差点就得肺炎了
on the verge of pneumonia 15 minutes later.

266
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,430
你那晚怎么样 警长
How was your evening, Chief?

267
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,140
这不是什么好消息啊  艾伯特
This is not good news, Albert.

268
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,860
她要见他
She needs to see him.

269
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,410
你出马吧
Your turn.

270
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,210
你会跟我一起吗
But you'll go with me?

271
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,570
-说"请"  -什么
- Say "Please." - What?

272
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,210
你听到的  别装了
You heard me.

273
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,260
请
Please.

274
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,950
联调局  你叫
FBI, champ.

275
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,450
戴安的朋友
Friends of Diane.

276
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,930
请进
Come on in.

277
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,530
谁来了
Who is it?

278
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,720
我的天
Oh, my God.

279
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
再见  戴安
See you later, Diane.

280
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,760
晚点见
Yeah, see you later.

281
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,040
这很快就可以结束了
Well, this won't take long.

282
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,050
我只是要把跟他说的话再和你们说一遍
I'm just gonna say the same thing to you I said to him.

283
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,900
别紧张  戴安
Now, take it easy, Diane,

284
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,580
我们坐下来
and let's just sit down

285
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,830
好好地聊一会
and have a nice, simple chat.

286
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,130
-你有咖啡吗  -没有
- You got any coffee? - No.

287
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,840
我也没有烟
I don't have any cigarettes either.

288
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,990
烟草的味道
Ah, the memory of tobacco.

289
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,680
可是我戒烟了
But I gave it up.

290
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,330
滚你的  戈登
Fuck you, Gordon.

291
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,820
她在对你人身攻击
Now you're getting the personal treatment.

292
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,910
你也想被人身攻击吗  你也滚吧  艾伯特
Oh, you want personal? Fuck you, too, Albert.

293
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,900
玩笑到此为止
Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way.

294
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,870
我从没和她谈到这个进度
I never even got this far.

295
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,800
戴安  你的前任老板
Diane, your former boss

296
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,250
前任特工戴尔·库柏
and former Special Agent Dale Cooper

297
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,070
被关在南达科他的联邦拘留所里
is in a federal lockup in South Dakota.

298
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,290
很好
Good.

299
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,440
戴安  你也许需要稍微改变一下态度
Diane, this may require a slight change of attitude on your part.

300
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,550
我的态度关你们屁事
My attitude is none of your fucking business.

301
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,870
不好对付啊
Tough cookie.

302
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,570
一向如此
Always was.

303
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,630
谢谢你  戴安
Thank you, Diane.

304
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,810
咖啡真好喝
Damn good coffee.

305
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,250
然后呢
So?

306
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,200
说吧  你们来这干什么
Say what you came here to say.

307
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,570
我们有预感出事了
We have a feeling something is wrong.

308
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,760
不知道具体是什么事
We don't know exactly what it is,

309
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,670
但是我们需要一个非常了解他的人
but we need someone else who knows him extremely well

310
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,760
去找他谈谈
to have a talk with him

311
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,200
然后告诉我们他的想法
and afterwards tell us what you think.

312
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,440
这事非常重要  戴安
This is extremely important, Diane,

313
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,090
这当中涉及到你知道的事
and it involves something that you know about,

314
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,800
这点就足够了
and that's enough said about that.

315
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,290
联邦监狱
Federal prison...

316
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,340
南达科他
South Dakota.

317
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,980
别挑刺  丑话说在前
Judge not, lest to be judged.

318
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,390
事实是
Listen, just the fact

319
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,840
你的行动比言语更有说服力
that you're here speaks louder than words.

320
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,900
滚你的  艾伯特
Fuck you, Albert.

321
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,930
你们看看这个
Look at this.

322
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,630
这边是二十五年前的库柏
Cooper 25 years ago...

323
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,610
另一边库柏两天前在监狱里
Cooper in prison two days ago.

324
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,890
完全一样  对吧
Identical, right?

325
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,330
也许吧
Maybe.

326
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,590
你们怎么认为
What do you see?

327
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,290
这个标记的位置是错的
This code mark's on the wrong side.

328
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,750
你觉得这说明了什么
What does that tell you?

329
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,600
监狱里的某个克罗马努人
That some Cro-Magnon at the prison

330
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,070
想要把这个上移  令其看似未经改动过
tried to line this up to make it look like the original,

331
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,730
但是他必须反向打印才行
but he had to reverse the print to do it.

332
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,710
"常非"  反过来写
YREV, the backwards word.

333
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,550
什么意思
What does this all mean?

334
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,090
塔米  你一直做得很好
Tammy, you've been doing excellent work,

335
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,630
通过了一个又一个的测验
passing one test after another.

336
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,320
伸出双手
Put out your hands.

337
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,240
掌心朝下
Flip 'em over.

338
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,710
我非常非常高兴
"I'm very, very happy

339
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,320
再次见到你
to see you again,

340
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,610
老朋友
old friend."

341
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,370
这是心灵之丘  心灵之指
This is the spiritual mound, the spiritual finger.

342
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,670
好好想想这些  塔米
You think about that, Tammy.

343
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,920
这是我们唯一的一张
That's the only known photograph we have of Cooper

344
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,550
库柏过去二十五年的照片
in the last 25 years.

345
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,530
里约郊外
That's outside of Rio...

346
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,930
他的房子
His house.

347
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,980
但在我们去搜查的时候
By the time we checked it out,

348
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,880
那房子却归某个伊帕内玛姑娘所有
it belonged to some girl from Ipanema.

349
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,600
他好像是我们在监狱里见到的那个人
Looks like the man we met in prison.

350
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,380
我们在监狱里见到的那个人
The man we met in prison.

351
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,080
苏城扬克顿联邦监狱

352
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,540
十分钟
Ten minutes.

353
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,330
我单独和他谈
And I speak to him alone.

354
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,650
最多十分钟
Ten minutes, tops,

355
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,810
或者我说结束就立刻结束
or it's over when I say it's over.

356
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,860
就是这样  戴安
That's exactly the way it's gonna be, Diane.

357
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,320
帘子和麦克风由你来控制
You'll control the curtain and the microphone.

358
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,540
我们非常地感谢你
And we're very appreciative.

359
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,660
再说一次你叫什么名字来着
What'd you say your name was, again?

360
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,940
塔米
Tammy.

361
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,720
滚你的  塔米
Fuck you, Tammy.

362
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,460
我就知道会是你
I knew it was going to be you.

363
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,200
很高兴再见到你  戴安
It's good to see you again, Diane.

364
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,440
是吗
Oh, yeah?

365
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,390
那是什么时候  库柏
When was that, Cooper?

366
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,050
我们上次见面是什么时候
When did we see each other last?

367
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,090
你在生我气吗  戴安
Are you upset with me, Diane?

368
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,250
你觉得呢
What do you think?

369
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,900
我觉得你在生我的气
I think you're upset with me.

370
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,700
我们上次见面是什么时候  库柏
When was the last time we saw each other, Cooper?

371
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,240
在你家
At your house.

372
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,680
对
That's right.

373
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,590
你还记得那晚吗
Do you remember that night?

374
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,180
我一直记得那晚
I'll always remember that night.

375
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,420
我也是
Same for me.

376
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,810
我永远也不会忘记
I'll never forget it.

377
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,960
你是谁
Who are you?

378
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,330
我不知道你什么意思  戴安
I don't know what you mean, Diane.

379
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,680
看着我
Look at me.

380
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,160
看着我
Look at me.

381
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,480
谢谢你  墨菲监狱长
Thank you, Warden Murphy.

382
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,490
-就这样吗  -是的
- That's it? - Looks like it.

383
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,020
再我们通知你之前  别放他走
Hold this man till you hear from us.

384
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,700
戴安
Diane?

385
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,590
听我说
Listen to me.

386
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,810
他不是我所认识的戴尔· 库柏
That is not the Dale Cooper that I knew.

387
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,140
请告诉你这话是什么意思
Please tell me exactly what you mean.

388
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,300
不是因为时间的流逝
It isn't time passing...

389
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,990
或他改变的方式
or how he's changed...

390
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,020
更不是他的样貌
or the way he looks.

391
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,350
而是这里
It's something here.

392
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,110
他这里绝对有些问题
There's something that definitely isn't here.

393
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,560
这样可以了  戴安
That's good enough for me, Diane.

394
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,430
可以了
That's good enough for me.

395
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,630
你在里面提到的昨晚
That last night you mentioned in there...

396
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,910
有什么我需要知道的吗
Something I need to know about?

397
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,230
改天我们再聊
You and I'll have a talk sometime.

398
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,400
我们会好好聊聊的
You and I will have a talk.

399
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,990
好吗
Okay?

400
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,840
好
Okay.

401
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,830
干杯
Cheers.

402
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,970
敬联调局
To the FBI.

403
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,020
听我说句话
Listen to me a minute.

404
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,010
告诉墨菲监狱长我有话要和他说
Tell Warden Murphy I have a message for him.

405
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,270
我要在他办公室里和他谈
I need to speak with him in his office.

406
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,720
想得美
Yeah, right.

407
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,590
就告诉他
Just tell him

408
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,510
我们要聊聊草莓
we need to speak about a strawberry.

409
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,530
让他坐下  然后你们出去吧
Sit him down and leave.

410
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,890
我已经把监视器关掉了
I've turned off the security cameras.

411
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,960
我们可以畅所欲言
We can speak freely...

412
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,930
私下聊聊
and privately.

413
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,240
狗腿
The dog leg.

414
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,100
那只狗有四条腿
That dog had four legs.

415
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,610
一条就是你在我车里找到的
One you found in my trunk.

416
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,230
另外三条和你正想得到的信息
The other three went out with the information

417
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,510
在一起
you're thinking about right now.

418
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,290
如果我出了什么事  会有两个
Two people you don't want coming around here

419
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,890
你不想看到的人来找你
if anything bad happens to me.

420
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,740
我怎么知道你知道...
How do I know you know anything about...

421
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,870
这些
this?

422
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,800
乔·麦克劳斯基
Joe McCluskey.

423
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,230
你想要什么
What do you want?

424
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,160
我要一辆车
I want a car.

425
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,570
便宜的租车就行
Cheap rental, if you like.

426
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,870
给我和雷·门罗用
For myself and Ray Monroe.

427
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,170
给车的柜子里备好东西
I want a friend in the glove compartment...

428
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,610
今晚一点
One A.M. Tonight.

429
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,880
稳健安全
Smooth and safe.

430
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,730
如果你想耍主意
And if your mind should wander to a place

431
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,680
让我没法活着出去
where I might not make it out of here alive,

432
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,920
记住狗腿
remember the dog legs.

433
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,340
我对你不感兴趣
I'm not interested in you.

434
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,110
你不会再看到我
You'll never see me again,

435
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,590
没人会再听到关于
and no one will ever hear anything more

436
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,910
乔·麦克劳斯基的事
about Joe McCluskey

437
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,940
或者你那位已死的草莓先生
or your late Mr. Strawberry.

438
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,830
你为什么不和我讲话  道吉
Is there a reason you're not talking to me, Dougie?

439
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,890
你和布什内尔之前在说什么
What were you and Bushnell discussing earlier?

440
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,300
我看到你...
I saw you...

441
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,750
拿着一叠文件进了他的办公室
walk into his office carrying a bunch of files.

442
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,120
有几位警官来找你  道吉
Uh, some police officers are here to see you, Dougie.

443
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,900
警官
Police.

444
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,410
让我想到我得打个电话
That reminds me of that call I have to make.

445
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,610
警官
Police.

446
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,830
要他们进来吗
You want them to come in here?

447
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,420
好吧
Okay.

448
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,860
琼斯先生
Mr. Jones?

449
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,250
我是弗斯科警探
Detectives Fusco.

450
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,580
警徽
Badge.

451
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,390
怎么回事
What's going on here?

452
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,430
你是谁  女士
Who are you, ma'am?

453
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,160
我是他的妻子
I'm his wife.

454
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,220
怎么回事
What's going on here?

455
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,210
我们是因为他的车而来
We're here about his car.

456
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,200
所以我才来
That's why I'm here.

457
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,960
你这话是什么意思
What do you mean by that?

458
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,160
我是来接他的
I'm picking him up.

459
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,630
他不知道他的车在哪里
He doesn't know where his car is.

460
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,330
被偷了吗
Was it stolen?

461
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,280
道吉  你的车被偷了吗
Dougie, was your car stolen?

462
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,930
偷
Stolen.

463
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,570
你报失了吗  先生
Did you report it stolen, sir?

464
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,310
先生
Sir.

465
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,780
你上报自己丢车了吗
Did you report your car as a stolen vehicle?

466
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,770
不  他没有报失
No, he did not report it stolen.

467
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,330
不然我肯定知道
I would know.

468
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,440
他的车不见了  我们也没见过
His car went missing. We haven't seen it.

469
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,780
这不是你们的工作吗
Isn't that your department?

470
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,930
没错  等报失之后
Yes, it is, once it's reported as missing.

471
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,720
我想现在亡羊补牢不算迟
Well, I guess this is as good a time as any.

472
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,320
他不知道车在哪里
He doesn't know where the car is.

473
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,080
他好几天没见过了
He hasn't seen it in a few days,

474
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,400
没错  很有可能
so, yes, there's a very strong possibility

475
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,100
被偷了
that it was stolen.

476
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,340
偷
Stolen.

477
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,390
那好吧  琼斯先生
All right, then, Mr. Jones,

478
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,690
你最后一次见到你的车是在哪里
where did you last leave your car?

479
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,650
我们要是知道
Well, if we knew that,

480
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,560
就知道该去哪里找了  是吗
we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we?

481
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,300
能形容一下你的车吗
Okay, can you describe your vehicle, please?

482
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,280
那是一辆破车  老是送去修
Ah, it's a terrible car, always in the shop...

483
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,050
银色四门廉价福特车
Silver, four-door, cheap Ford,

484
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,670
那个经销商都把它叫做
the kind they call down at that dealer

485
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,220
二手车
a "Previously owned" Car.

486
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,110
车是什么时候丢的
When, uh, did the car go missing?

487
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,400
道吉
Dougie?

488
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,220
道吉
Dougie.

489
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,650
几天前
A few days ago.

490
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,400
几...
Few...

491
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,790
天前
days ago.

492
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,010
你不报失有什么原因吗
Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing?

493
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,620
原因  我告诉你原因
Reason? Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.

494
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,520
生活中有比车更重要的东西
There's more to life than cars.

495
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,160
太多车  太多事
Too many cars, too much going on,

496
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,470
道吉最近压力很大
and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately,

497
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,250
如果你想知道真相  我也想
and if you want to know the truth, so have I.

498
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,430
警官们  你们找到车了吗
Officers, have you found the car?

499
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,500
你是谁  先生
Who are you, sir?

500
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,550
这地方是他的
He owns this place.

501
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,310
布什内尔·穆林斯
Bushnell Mullins.

502
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,240
道吉为我工作
Dougie works for me.

503
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,650
你们没找到他的车  对吗
You did find his car, didn't you?

504
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,950
车被找到了
The car has been found.

505
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,730
和一起爆炸案有关
It was involved in an apparent explosion.

506
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,330
多人死亡
Multiple fatalities.

507
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,560
你们为什么不一开始就告诉我们
Why didn't you tell us that to begin with?

508
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,000
死的人似乎和一系列
The deceased individuals had ties to a gang

509
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,440
汽车盗窃案有关
associated with multiple car thefts.

510
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,620
你们要的回答已经给你们了
Well, there's your answer.

511
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,070
不介意的话
Now, if you don't mind,

512
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,120
我们的儿子还在家里等着吃晚饭
our son's home alone waiting for his supper,

513
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,160
以防你们觉得我监护不当  顺便说一声
and in case you think we're neglecting him,

514
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,400
邻居在帮忙照看他
he's being watched by our neighbor as a favor,

515
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,380
我们要走了
and we'd like to go.

516
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,900
经过了非常漫长紧张的一天后
We were supposed to be home by now

517
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,190
我们现在应该在家里
at the end of a very long and stressful day,

518
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,730
我待会告诉你发生了什么  道吉
which I'll tell you about later, Dougie.

519
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,960
-我们走  -等等
- Come on, let's go. - Hold on.

520
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,730
我知道我们来这里
And I'm sure our being here

521
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,840
给你添了不少麻烦  女士
hasn't made your day any easier, ma'am,

522
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,780
但我们想让你们填一些文件
but we're gonna need you to fill out some paperwork.

523
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,240
如果你们不方便  我们可以代劳
Which we can take care of at your convenience.

524
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,460
明早给我们打个电话
Please, give us a call in the morning.

525
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,980
谢谢你们的合作
And, uh, thank you for your cooperation.

526
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,810
祝你们今晚愉快
Have a pleasant evening.

527
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,560
晚安
Evening.

528
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,190
他收保险的时候
I guess he won't have any trouble

529
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,130
肯定"完全没问题"吧
collecting the insurance, huh?

530
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,360
我对你给我的那些文件
I have some questions about those files

531
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,390
有点问题  道吉
you covered for me, Dougie.

532
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,590
但你去吧
But you go ahead.

533
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,100
那些可以明天再说
We can take care of that tomorrow.

534
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,170
谢谢  穆林斯先生
Thanks, Mr. Mullins.

535
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,010
谢谢...穆林斯
Thank you... Mullins.

536
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,470
我见过他们了
So I met with them.

537
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,310
我告诉他们该还多少就还多少
I told them what the arrangements were gonna be,

538
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,310
我还多给了他们不少
and I gave them more than they deserved,

539
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,420
他们不会来找我们了  好吗
and that's the end of them, okay?

540
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,730
关于车的事
Now, with this car business,

541
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,900
没错  肯定要找保险赔点钱
yes, there's gonna be some insurance money.

542
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,290
我也不清楚  但是道吉  好好想想
I don't know how much, but, Dougie, just think.

543
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,340
要是你当初没有把钱都赌没了
If you hadn't blown that money gambling...

544
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,780
两万五加保险的钱
$25,000 plus the insurance...

545
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,920
我们可以给你买辆新车
We could have gotten you a great new car.

546
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,260
现在谁知道我们还有什么
Now who knows what we'll get?

547
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,280
但是我不想再放你
But I do not want you running off

548
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
用那些奖金去赌博了
and gambling any more of that jackpot.

549
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,740
那笔钱是给桑尼·吉姆和我们的未来准备的
That money is for Sonny Jim and our future.

550
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,690
现在有这笔钱
Just 'cause you have it now

551
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,260
你也不能就这么失踪
doesn't mean you can just run off

552
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,380
拿我们的钱去冒险
and risk one more penny.

553
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,020
听到了吗
Do you hear me?

554
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,490
不许再去...
No more gam...

555
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,100
放开他
Get off him!

556
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,190
把他的手捏下来
Squeeze his hand off.

557
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,890
把他的手捏下来
Squeeze his hand off.

558
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,420
把他的手捏下来
Squeeze his hand off.

559
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,070
道吉
Dougie!

560
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,040
你们没事吧
Are you guys okay?

561
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,580
天啊
Oh, my God.

562
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,090
你没事吧
Are you okay?

563
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,570
道吉
Oh, Dougie.

564
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,370
怎么...你没事吧
What... Are you okay?

565
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,090
他就这么...就...
And he just... he just...

566
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,280
道吉走上前
Dougie took right over,

567
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
掐住他的喉咙
and he just chopped him right in the throat

568
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,970
说"放手"  我踢他
and said, "You get off," And I kicked him,

569
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,080
我打他  就是这样
and I punched him, and that was it,

570
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,670
然后...然后道吉就把他解决了
and... and Dougie just took care of business.

571
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,150
对吗  宝贝
Right, baby?

572
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,590
真是...太可怕了
It was... it was terrible.

573
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,170
拿枪的那个人吗
What about the man with the gun?

574
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,520
他冲向我
He ran right at me.

575
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,300
几乎把我撞倒
Almost knocked me down.

576
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,780
他闻上去好奇怪
He smelled funny.

577
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,050
受害者
Victim? Oh, no.

578
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,920
那家伙才不像个受害者
That guy didn't act like any victim.

579
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,310
道格拉斯·琼斯  他跟眼镜蛇一样敏捷
Douglas Jones... He moved like a cobra.

580
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,320
我就看到人影一闪
All I saw was a blur.

581
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,350
你第一次听到这些声音是什么时候
When did you first start hearing this?

582
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,260
上周吧
Sometime last week.

583
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,080
但我觉得现在更响了
But I think it's louder now.

584
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,310
也许是因为这里没有人
Maybe that's 'cause nobody's here.

585
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,080
别动
Don't move.

586
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,210
仔细听
Just listen carefully.

587
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,690
你觉得是从
Where do you think...

588
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,770
哪里来的
it's coming from?

589
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,910
现在听上去
Now... now it sounds like

590
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,940
像是从那里来的  对吗
it's coming from over there, no?

591
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,640
没错
It sure does.

592
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,970
不
No.

593
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,860
也不是这里
No, it's not here either.

594
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,730
这东西可能有点意思
Oh, this might be of interest.

595
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,560
今天寄过来的
It came in the mail today.

596
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,650
天啊
Wow. My God.

597
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,630
这可有点年头了
That's an old one.

598
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,070
我们20年前就用房卡了

等等
Wait a minute.

601
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,540
我觉得库伯特工
I think that was the room

602
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,880
就是在那里中枪的
where Agent Cooper was shot.

603
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,110
库伯特工是谁
Who's Agent Cooper?

604
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,170
联调局的
FBI.

605
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,710
他应该  25年前来过这里
He was here, I don't know, maybe 25 years ago...

606
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,220
调查劳拉·帕尔默的死
investigating the murder of Laura Palmer.

607
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,550
劳拉·帕尔默是谁
Who's Laura Palmer?

608
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,040
亲爱的
Oh, that, my dear...

609
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,390
那可说来话长了

612
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,900
现在他们肯定已经下班了

他好多了
He's better,

621
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,160
但我得给他加大止痛药量

我发誓  那是个梦

58
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,300
他
Well, he's, uh,

59
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,810

00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,390
天啊
Oh, my God.

66
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,750
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

你做得很好
You did good.

68
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,270
你很好地遵从了本性
You follow human nature perfectly.

69
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,490
这是乔治的枪
This is George's gun.

内华达州  拉斯维加斯

罗杰  进来
Roger, come in here.

72
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,680
告诉她她被录用了

73
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,390
托德先生
Mr. Todd?

Yes, Roger?

75
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,290
我能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

76
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,940
说吧
Go ahead.

77
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,240
你为什么让他逼你
Why do you let him make you...

78
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,990
做这些事
do these things?

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,790
罗杰
Roger...

80
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,710
你最好祈祷
...you better hope

81
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,410
永远别和他这种人扯上关系
that you never get involved with someone like him.

82
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,890
这辈子别遇上
Never have someone like him

83
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,890
他这种人
in your life.

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,650
杰克  你的三份晚餐都没怎么吃呢
Jack, you barely touched your three dinners.

85
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,300
听达雅说
Darya said something about you,

86
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,350
你在担心明天的事
uh, being worried about tomorrow?

87
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,860
还是后天的事
Or the day after?

88
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,190
我不担心  雷
I'm not worried, Ray,

89
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,230
什么也不担心
about anything.

90
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,660
那挺好啊
Well, that's good.

91
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,070
后天开始
For a while, day after tomorrow,

92
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,850
我得单独行动一阵子
I'll need to be on my own.

93
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,130
到时候你就能好好学习
That might be a good time for you to learn

94
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,650
如何管好你自己的事
how to mind your own business.

95
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,580
好吧
Well...

96
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,740
在这期间  有什么我能帮上忙的
meantime, there's anything I can do to help,

97
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,790
尽管告诉我
just let me know.

98
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,060
我会的  雷
I'll be sure to let you know, Ray.

99
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
我会跟进我那个线人
And I'll follow up on that contact of mine,

100
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,600
希望能拿到你需要的信息

101
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,630
我想要
Want,

102
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,560

103

我什么也不需要  雷

104
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,180
关于我这个人
If there's one thing you should know

105
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,930
你得知道  雷
about me, Ray,

106
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,550
我什么也不需要
it's that I don't need anything.

107
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,730
我想要
I want.

108
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,060
我想要那个信息
And I want that information.

109
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,030
她只愿意给你也是挺可笑的
Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.

110
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,010
这信息似乎对你很重要
This information seems pretty important to you.

111
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,220
别担心  我会帮你拿到的

她是黑斯廷斯的秘书

114
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,960
他知道的她都知道

115
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,580
玛格丽特

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,660
霍克
Hawk.

117
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,380
你今晚走去哪儿

118
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,680
我再一次和你的木头同步了
Once again, your log and I are on the same page.

119
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,880
这里今晚应该会有事发生

120
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,530
众星转动
The stars turn...

121
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,040
时间自我呈现
and the time presents itself.

122
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,610
霍克
Hawk,

123
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,760
仔细观察

124
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,260
我会的  玛格丽特
I will, Margaret.

125
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,280
我太虚弱  没能和你一起去
I'm too weak to go with you.

126
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,710
但顺道来一趟
But stop by.

127
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,830
我给你准备了咖啡和派
I have coffee and pie for you.

128
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,490
得晚一点了  我快到了
Gonna have to be after. I'm almost there now.

129
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,760
请告诉我发生什么事
Please, let me know what happens.

130
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,960
我会的  玛格丽特
I will, Margaret.

131
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,020
晚安  玛格丽特
Good night, Margaret.

132
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,950
那是

133
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,660
未来

134
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,540
还是

135
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,910
那是

136
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,980
过去

137
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,790
有人

138
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,270
来

139
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,010
了

140
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,610
你好

141
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,160
库柏探员

142
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,520
你现在

143
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,240
可以

144
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,100
出去了

145
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,710
你认得我吗

146
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,980
你是劳拉·帕尔默吗
Are you Laura Palmer?

147
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,220
我好像认识她

148
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,690
但有时我的手臂

149
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,690
向后弯

150
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,270
你是谁
Who are you?

151
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,670
我是

152
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,980
劳拉·帕尔默

153
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,910
劳拉·帕尔默已经死了
But Laura Palmer is dead.

154
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,300
我

155
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,170
确实死了

156
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,470
但我以这样的方式活着

157
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,550
我什么时候可以离开
When can I go?

158
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,440
这是

159
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,150
未来

160
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,980
还是说

161
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,410
这是

162
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,380
过去

163
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,000
这是手臂的

164
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,170
进化

165
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,490
我

166
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,240
就是

167
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,550
手臂

168
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,940
而且  我

169
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,390
听起来像

170
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,800
这样

171
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,260
你

172
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,660
还记得

173
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,280
你的

174
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,330
分身吗

175
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,580
他

176
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,060
必须要

177
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,410
在

178
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,870
你

179
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,950
走

180
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,880
之前

181
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,680
回到

182
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,680
你

183
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,460
身上

184
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,120
杰克  过来一下
Jack, come here.

185
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,840
妈的
Shit.

186
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,050
他要进来了  我要挂电话了
He's coming. I have to get off the phone.

187
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,220
宝贝
Hi, baby.

188
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,920
你在跟谁讲电话
Who you talking to?

189
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,760
杰克
Um, Jack.

190
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,520
只是想跟他确认一下
Just making sure I get the job done

191
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,150
我在秘书的车上动的手脚都搞定了
on the secretary's car.

192
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,750
那杰克怎么说
What did Jack say?

193
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,160
他说一切顺利
He said it's all good to go.

194
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,660
我很开心能见到你
I'm happy to see you.

195
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,410
我还以为
I thought maybe you'd

196
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,800
可能你自己跑哪去待了一阵子
gone off on your own for a while,

197
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,150
如你之前所说的
like you were saying.

198
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,690
你见到我很高兴吗  达雅
You're happy to see me, Darya?

199
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,820
高兴  宝贝
Yeah, baby.

200
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,130
真好  达雅
That's nice, Darya.

201
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,420
雷本来打算今天下午跟我见面的
Ray was supposed to meet me this afternoon.

202
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,290
-但他没出现  -是吗
- He never showed. - Oh, yeah?

203
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,380
是的
Yeah.

204
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,720
你那枪放哪了  达雅
Where's that .45 of yours, Darya?

205
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,620
我把它放我床头了
I've got it here by the bed.

206
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,650
怎么了吗
What's up?

207
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,910
我可能要借用一下
Might want to borrow it for a job.

208
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,360
我的就是你的
What's mine is yours.

209
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,780
达雅  杰克死了
Darya, Jack is dead.

210
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,050
两小时之前在他把车弄好后  我把他杀了
I killed Jack two hours ago after he wired the car.

211
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,080
别动
Don't move...

212
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,540
一丁点都不要动
...one muscle.

213
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,300
我要放个东西给你听  达雅
I'm gonna play something for you, Darya.

214
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,640
我们都会觉得有趣的东西
I think we'll both find this interesting.

215
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,340
达雅  是你吗
Darya, is that you?

216
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,230
雷  你他妈在哪啊
Ray, where the hell are you?

217
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,930
我在联邦监狱  南达科塔州
Federal prison, South Dakota.

218
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,250
搞什么鬼  你犯了什么事  雷
What the fuck? What did you do, Ray?

219
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,810
过州边境的时候携带了武器
Carried weapons over the state line.

220
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,900
我搞砸了  挑在最差的时机
I fucked up, the worst possible moment.

221
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,820
你怎么给我打电话的
How are you calling me?

222
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,190
这是个一次性手机  不用担心
This is a burner. Don't worry about it.

223
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,660
没有人偷听
Nobody's listening.

224
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,050
库柏那边  我们要做些什么
So what do we do about Cooper?

225
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,210
杰弗里斯打过给我
I got another call from Jeffries.

226
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,360
如果库柏明晚还活着  你一定要杀了他
You have to hit Cooper if he's still around tomorrow night.

227
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,390
现在  达雅  你必须这么做
That means you now, Darya. You have to do this.

228
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,990
操
Fuck.

229
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,710
操  他刚停车  操
Fuck, I think his car just pulled up.Fuck!

230
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,420
看看明天什么情况吧
Let's see what happens tomorrow.

231
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,380
如果形势所迫  我会搞定他的
If I have to, I'll take him out.

232
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,800
妈的  他要进来了  我要挂电话了
Shit, he's coming. I got to get off the phone.

233
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,760
你是要杀了我吗
Are you going to kill me?

234
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,000
是的  达雅
Yes, Darya.

235
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,200
操
Shit!

236
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,010
达雅...
Darya...

237
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,200
是谁雇你和雷来杀我的
who hired you and Ray to kill me?

238
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,400
我不知道
I don't know.

239
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,440
我不知道
I don't know.

240
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,860
我发誓  我不...
I swear, I don't...

241
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,430
雷知道
Ray knows.

242
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,660
我不知道  他没告诉过我
I don't know. He never told me.

243
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,670
你真指望我会相信
Do you really expect me to believe that

244
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,060
雷进监狱是因为持枪跨越州界吗
Ray's in prison for carrying guns over a state line?

245
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,090
达雅  看着我
Darya, look at me.

246
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,370
这事想来还挺有趣的
This is quite an interesting thing to think about.

247
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,730
游戏开始了
The game begins.

248
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,030
他说过他们为什么想杀死我吗
Did he say why they want me dead?

249
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,440
没有  我不知道为什么
No, I don't know why.

250
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,020
他们有多想我死  他们给了你们多少钱
How much do they want me dead? What are they paying you?

251
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,160
我们分了50万
We'd split a half a million.

252
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,190
我不想这么干的
I wouldn't have done it.

253
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,930
我告诉过雷
I just said that to Ray.

254
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,480
闭嘴  达雅
Shut up, Darya.

255
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,260
但是...
But...

256
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,870
你说过你明天要去某个地方
you said you were going away somewhere tomorrow.

257
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,270
明天
Tomorrow,

258
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,480
我本来会被拉回一个叫黑色小屋的地方
I'm supposed to get pulled back into what they call the Black Lodge.

259
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
但我不会回那里了
But I'm not going back there.

260
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,290
我想了个计划
I've got a plan for that one.

261
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,340
但雷那个混蛋进监狱这件事...
But this prison thing with that fucker Ray...

262
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,080
达雅   雷是从黑斯廷斯的秘书那里得到的消息吗
Darya, did Ray get that information from Hastings' secretary?

263
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,880
他有和你提过具体坐标吗
Did he ever mention coordinates to you?

264
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,710
我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that is.

265
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,570
地理坐标  数字  字母
Geographical coordinates, numbers, letters.

266
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,280
这些东西可以救你一命
They could save your life.

267
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,980
他说过她告诉了他一些事情  但我不知道是什么
He said she told him something, but I don't know what.

268
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,520
有人给你看过这个吗
Anybody ever show this to you before?

269
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,750
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

270
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,300
你之前有见过类似的东西吗
Did you ever see anything like this?

271
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,230
我想要的就是这个
This is what I want.

272
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,430
你现在是要杀了我吗
Are you gonna kill me now?

273
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,720
是的  达雅
Yes, Darya.

274
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,120
菲利普
Phillip?

275
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,720
你迟到了
You're late.

276
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,460
我也无能为力
Couldn't be helped.

277
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,620
在纽约我错过了你
I missed you in New York,

278
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,570
但我看你还在鹿角镇
but I see you're still in Buckhorn.

279
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,970
而你还是不知所踪  是不是
And you're still nowhere, is that correct?

280
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,400
你见到了少校加兰德·布里格斯
You met with Major Garland Briggs.

281
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,460
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

282
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,920
菲利普
Phillip?

283
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,380
实际上  我打电话给你是为了道别的
Actually, I just called to say good-bye.

284
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,150
你是菲利普·杰弗里斯吧
This is Phillip Jeffries, right?

285
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,470
你明天就得回来了

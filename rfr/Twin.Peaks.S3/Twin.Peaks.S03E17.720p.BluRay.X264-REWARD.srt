我做不到  艾伯特
I couldn't do it, Albert.

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,720
我做不到
I couldn't do it.

5
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,460
你越老越心软了
You've gone soft in your old age.

6
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,570
什么
What?

7
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,180
我说  你越老越心软了
I said, "You've gone soft in your old age."

8
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,210
该硬的时候可没软过  伙计

25年来
For 25 years,

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,670
布里格斯少校消失前
Before he disappeared,

15
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,720
曾跟我和库柏分享过
Major Briggs shared with me and Cooper

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,870
他关于一种存在物的发现
his discovery of an entity,

17

一种极度消极的力量

18
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,940
在古代被称作乔德伊

19
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,180
随着时间推移  渐渐变成了"朱迪"
Over time, it's become "Judy."

20
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,840
布里格斯少校  库柏和我想了个计划
Major Briggs, Cooper, and I put together a plan

21
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,660
能带我们找到朱迪
that could lead us to Judy.

22
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,730
然后布里格斯少校就出事了
And then something happened to Major Briggs,

23
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,340
库柏也出事了

一个叫雷·门罗的收钱线人

发来一条隐晦的信息

55
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,900
暗示我们在监狱里见到的库柏

正在寻找做坐标

某个布里格斯少校的坐标

这个计划  艾伯特
This plan, Albert,

59
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,480
我不能告诉你
I couldn't tell you about,

60
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,810
很抱歉
and I'm sorry.

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,800
我明白
I understand.

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,770
我知道你明白  艾伯特
I know you understand, Albert,

63
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,310
然而我还是很抱歉
yet I'm still sorry.

64
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,860
我完全不知道这计划的进展是否正常
And I don't know at all if this plan is unfolding properly

65
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,620
因为我们现在应该
'cause we should have heard by now

66
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,560
收到亲爱的戴尔·库柏的消息了

我的海德利特工  长官
Agent Headley here, sir.

我们找到道格拉斯·琼斯了
We found Douglas Jones.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,040
但是  我们不知道他在哪
But... we don't know where he is.

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,390
是我的手表停了
Has my watch stopped,

73
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,480
还是说这是马克斯兄弟中的一个
or is that one of the Marx Brothers?

74
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,730
这话是什么意思  海德利
What the hell does that mean, Headley?

75
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,450
床上没人
The bed is empty.

76
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,530
现在我的小队正在把所有东西发给你
My team is sending everything to you as we speak.

77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,920
科尔局长  全都理清楚了
Director Cole, we got it all--

79
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,170
电话那头是戈登·科尔吗
Is that Gordon Cole on the phone?

80
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,260
正是
Yes, it is.

81
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,110
-怎么了  -我有信息要给他

82
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,300
来自道吉的信息
A message from Dougie.

83
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,530
你说什么
What's that?

84
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,720
你说什么
What's that?

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,890
这儿有个人...他说他有来自道格拉斯·琼斯的
Uh, there's a man here-- he says he has a message

86
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,650
信息要告诉你
for you from Douglas Jones.

87
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,110
那就告诉我吧
Well, give it to me.

88
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,850
请问你是戈登·科尔先生吗
Am I talking to Mr. Gordon Cole?

89
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,200
是我本人
Yes, you are.

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,140
道吉要我念这条信息给你
Well, Dougie wanted me to read you this--

91
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,750
"我要前往
"I am headed

92
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,290
杜鲁门警长那里
for Sheriff Truman's.

93
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,060
现在拉斯维加斯是2点53分
It's 2:53 in Las Vegas,

94
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,100
加起来等于10
and that adds up to a ten,

95
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,670
这数字代表完成"
the number of completion."

96
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,110
他写的就这些
That's all he wrote.

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,310
而先生你的大名是
And what is your name, sir?

98
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,700
布什内尔·穆林斯

101
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,350
谢谢  穆林斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Mullins.

102
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,280
万分感激
Thank you very much.

103
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,060
我们俩都感谢你
And that makes two of us.

104
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,470
道吉就是库柏
Dougie is Cooper?

105
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,130
到底怎么回事
How the hell is this?

106
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,320
曾有人引爆道吉·琼斯的车
They blew up Dougie Jones' car.

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,660
还有位恶名昭彰的杀手
Then a notorious hit man

108
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,000
企图在他的公司外枪击他
tried to shoot him outside his place of business.

109
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,460
有人见到他在公司里
He's been spotted in the company

110
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,040
和两位犯罪集团首领在一起
of two organized-crime figures.

111
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,770
他把叉子插进了墙上的插座里...
He electrocuted himself by sticking a fork...

112
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,710
然后触电了
in a wall socket.

113
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,240
这就有点奇怪了  库柏也不干这种怪事
That's strange, even for Cooper.

114
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,660
应该又是一桩蓝玫瑰案
A Blue Rose case, most definitely.

115
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,110
他直到今下午还都在医院昏迷不醒
He was hospitalized in a coma until earlier this afternoon.

116
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,120
准备出发  我知道他要去哪里了
Pack it up! I know where he's going.

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,510
终于安静了
Finally.

119
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,790
你个混蛋
You fucker.

120
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,710
混蛋
Fucker.

121
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,000
去你妈的
Fuck you.

122
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,620
去你妈的
Fuck you.

123
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,470
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is that?

124
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,990
不知道啊  伙计
No clue, mate.

125
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,480
"不知道啊  伙计"

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,550
是的
Yes.

130
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,230
我们这有个伙计...
Got a guy here--

131
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,730
没带身份证  不肯告诉我们名字
no identification, won't give his name,

132
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,300
说他是你的哥哥

133
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,490
还说他用望远镜杀了人

134
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,750
那是我哥哥  杰瑞·霍恩
That's my brother, Jerry Horne.

135
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,010
他现在有什么指控吗
Is he charged with anything?

136
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,370
没有
No.

137
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,590
我会派人把他接回来的
I'll make arrangements to get him home.

138
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,000
你叫什么名字
What's your name again?

139
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,110
威廉姆斯警官  杰克逊镇警局
Sergeant Williams, Jackson Hole Police.

140
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,000
你可以寄点衣服来
And you can send clothes.

141
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,160
我们发现他的时候他是一丝不挂
When we picked him up, he was completely naked.

142
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,040
祝您度过美好的一天  先生

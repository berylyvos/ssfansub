劳拉
Laura.

136
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,280
你找错人了  先生

137
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,500
你是说你不是劳拉·帕尔默吗

138
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,110
劳拉什么
Laura who?

139
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,470
不  我不是她
No, I'm not her.

140
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,420
现在
Now--

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,270
现在我要关门了  所以
Now, I got to go, so...

146
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,160
等等
Wait.

147
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,120
所以你对劳拉·帕尔默一点印象都没有吗
So the name Laura Palmer means nothing to you?

148
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,040
听着
Look...

149
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,830
我不知道你想要什么
I don't know what you want,

150
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,150

是的  萨拉
Yes, Sarah.

156
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,900
怎么了
What's going on?

157
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,880
很难解释
It's difficult to explain.

158
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,730
和听起来一样奇怪
As strange as it sounds,

159
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,710
我觉得你叫劳拉·帕尔默
I think you're a girl named Laura Palmer.

160
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,180
我想带你回你母亲家...

你这样的人上门来

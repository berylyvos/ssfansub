什么情况
What have you got?

29
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,850
我一点儿也不喜欢你的措辞  上校
I don't appreciate your language one bit, Colonel.

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,300

几部干净的手机
A couple clean phones.

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,710
弄点它的子弹
And something for this.

56
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,420
先别管这个了
Well, fuck that.

57
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,020
我给你找把好枪
I'll get you some real nice puppies and biscuits.

58
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,620
香塔尔
Hey, Chantal.

59
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,400
老板来了
Boss man's here.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,590
把工具拿出来
Grab the kit.

61
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,130
他受伤了吗
Is he hurt?

62
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,450
操
Shit.

63
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,260
我们等了你一晚上
We was waiting for you all night.

64
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,050
打中哪了
Where're they get you?

65
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,350
还好你走运
Looks like you was lucky.

66
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,730
我去拿工具
I'll get the kit.

67
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,210
到里面去
Go on inside.

68
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,020
你看我们能不能先不直接回费城
Rather than return directly to Philadelphia,

69
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,320
介不不介意我们去一趟
would you mind if we made a short trip

70
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,310
南科达州的鹿角镇
to Buckhorn, South Dakota?

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,090
这事挺重要的
It's quite important.

72
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,010
去你妈的  戈登  我想回家
Fuck you, Gordon. I want to go home.

73
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,010
事关重大
This is important,

74
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,930
你也会感兴趣的  戴安
and it could be of interest to you, Diane.

75
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,890
一个老案子  涉及一个

76
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,350
库柏特工曾经认识的人

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,070
蓝玫瑰案
The Blue Rose case.

78
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,790
是的
Yes.

79
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,440
马上给你送来
Coming up.

80
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,830
我得先去跟机长说下

计划有变

82
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,220
我们要去南科达州的鹿角镇

83
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,620

84
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,110
我知道  "去你妈的  艾伯特"

85
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,900
已被屏蔽

86
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,510
我是普雷斯顿探员
Agent Preston.

87
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,920
好
Good.

88
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,050
我明白了  我叫他接
Yes, I understand. I'll get him.

89
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,480
是墨菲典狱长
It's Warden Murphy.

90
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,020
墨菲典狱长
Warden Murphy?

91
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,000
你们的库柏越狱了
Your man Cooper escaped.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,450
什么
What?

93
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,440
怎么会这样
How the hell did that happen?

94
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,570
库柏越狱了
Cooper flew the coop.

95
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,760
晚饭时的谈话气氛很活跃

96
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,850
发送

97
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,920
你动手了吗
Did you do it?

98
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,710
还没有
Not yet.

99
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,280
最好下次我打电话来时已经搞定了
Better be done next time I call.

100
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,940
罗杰  进来

101
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,970
这个行吗  老板

真的挺不错的  哈齐
It's real good, Hutch.

103
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,770
好
All right.

104
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,070
我要你接下来两天内杀了典狱长
I want you to kill a warden within the next two days.

105
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,460
典狱长
A warden?

106
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,880
行
All right.

107
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,470
你要香塔尔在我动手之前跟他鬼混一下吗
You want Chantal to mess with him before I come?

108
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,410
他会玩得很尽兴的
He'll sing for me.

109
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,750
随你们吧
Whatever you want.

110
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,450
我给你们在拉斯维加斯弄了一辆双车头火车
Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.

111
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,360
那就开双头
Oh, let's play two.

112
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,430
做掉典狱长后我会把详细情况短信给你
I'll text you details after you do the warden.

113
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,120
记住
Remember this.

114
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,560
扬克顿联邦监狱的墨菲典狱长
Warden Murphy, Yankton Federal Prison.

115
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,030
在他家  或是上班的地方
Kill him at home, at work,

116
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,680
或是上班路上把他杀了
or on the way.

117
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,800
好
Okay.

118
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,570
香塔尔
Hey, Chantal,

119
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,940
给老板一个湿吻
give the boss man a wet one.

120
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,020
真希望可以继续
I wish it was more.

121
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,310
以后一定补上
I'll take a rain check.

122
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,410
没问题  亲爱的
You got it, sweetheart.

123
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,070
销毁这部手机
Kill that phone.

124
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,940
把这里清理干净
And clear out of this place.

125
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,450
主路在那边
The main road is that way.

126
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,510
拉斯维加斯警局

127
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,630
他惹过什么麻烦吗
He ever give any problems?

128
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,050
没有  道吉从来不给我惹麻烦
No, I never had any trouble with Dougie at all.

129
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,330
他是个  好市民
He's a... solid citizen.

130
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,140
所以你不知道为什么
So you can't think of any reason

131
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,830
会有人想杀他
why someone would try to kill him.

132
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,810
我想不出原因
Not off the top of my head.

133
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,020
当然  在保险业中
Of course, in the insurance business,

134
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,950
如果有人事不遂愿
folks have been known to hold a grudge

135
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,780
难免会心存嫉恨
if things don't go their way.

136
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,140
通常都是为了钱  布什内尔
It's usually about money, Bushnell.

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,550
简单纯粹
Pure and simple.

138
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,710
也不需要什么其它原因了
Nobody needs more reason than that.

139
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,250
他是什么来头
So what's his background?

140
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,010
他在你手下做事做了多久了
How long has he been with you?

141
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,820
已经十二年了
Twelve years now.

142
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,240
他是个好雇员
He's a good worker.

143
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,430
他做事慢条斯理
He's slow, steady.

144
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,590
我看重点在"慢"吧
Little more emphasis on the "slow."

145
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,010
据我所知  道吉出了一场车祸
Dougie had a car accident, as I recall,

146
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,670
那是在他来我这上班不久前
not long before he came to work for me.

147
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,280
他偶尔
Every once in a while,

148
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,550
还会出现一些后遗症
he shows some lingering effects.

149
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,480
他妻子应该比我更了解情况
His wife can talk to that better than I can.

150
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,920
那...
Well...

151
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,640
很感谢你过来一趟  布什内尔
we appreciate you coming down, Bushnell.

152
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,500
很感谢你们的帮助

等待室
The waiting room.

300
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,910
就在我们后面
They're right behind us.

301
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,630
-诺克斯中尉  -长官
- Lieutenant Knox. - Sir.

302
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,140
麦克利
Macklay.

303
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,710
戴安
Diane.

304
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,180
我今天早上没心情看死尸
I'm not in the mood to see a dead body this morning.

305
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,160
我就在这儿等你们吧
I'll just wait for you guys here.

306
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,850
很抱歉  女士  你不能在这儿吸烟
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't smoke here.

307
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,210
这他妈的是个停尸房
It's a fucking morgue!

308
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,240
这边走
This way.

309
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,760
死娘炮
Fuckin' Pansies.

310
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,820
晚饭时的谈话气氛很活跃

311
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,370
案子一开始是麦克利侦探负责的
Detective Macklay handled the case when it came in.

312
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,320
他会给你简要介绍背景的
He'll brief you on background.

313
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,360
威廉·黑斯廷斯那时候在和
William Hastings was having an affair

314
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,890
本地图书管理员露丝·达文波特搞婚外情
with the local librarian, Ruth Davenport.

315
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,000
现在  达文波特的头被发现在
Now, Davenport's head was found

316
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,420
布里格斯少校的无头身体上
atop the headless body of your Major Briggs.

317
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,540
我们刚一把黑斯廷斯抓起来
Once we took Hastings into custody,

318
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,340
他妻子在他们的房子里被杀
his wife was murdered in their house,

319
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,940
很显然是被他们的律师所杀
apparently by their lawyer,

320
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,590
一个叫乔治·邦思的男人
a man named George Bouncer,

321
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,090
现在也被抓起来了
who is now also in custody.

322
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,940
第二天
And the next day,

323
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,660
黑斯廷斯的秘书死在一场汽车爆炸中
Hastings's Secretary died in a car explosion.

324
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,990
第二季发生了什么
What happens in season two?

325
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,120
提前为艾伯特道歉
Apologies in advance for Albert.

326
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,800
这就是布里格斯少校
Well, this is your Major Briggs.

327
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,610
原来威廉·黑斯廷斯
It turns out that William Hastings,

328
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,300
在图书管理员露丝的帮助下
along with the help of Ruth the librarian,

329
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,280
调查并发表
was researching and publishing

330
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,200
一些关于其它维度的
some strange little blog

331
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,540
奇怪的博客
about some alternate dimension.

332
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,900
这是你们本地高中校长说的
This from the principal of your local high school.

333
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,350
他还是六年级的弹珠比赛冠军
Not to mention, marble champion of the sixth grade.

334
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,850
他什么时候把弹珠丢了
When did he lose his marbles?

335
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,970
狗抢走了他的猫眼弹珠
When the dog got his cat's eyes.

336
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,570
大约一周前  黑斯廷斯在博客最后
About one week ago, Hastings ended his blog entry

337
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,710
写了这么一句谜语
with this cryptic sentence:

338
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,130
今天我们终于进入了那个空间
"Today we finally entered what we call the Zone,

339
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,210
还遇到了少校
and we met the Major."

340
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,650
这是具四十几岁的男尸
This is the body of a man in his 40s.

341
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,960
对
Yes.

342
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,650
艾伯特
Albert.

343
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,540
我们好好想想
Let's think out loud.

344
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,890
布里格斯少校应该已经72岁了
Major Briggs would have been 72.

345
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,960
如你所知  我们以为他在25年前
As you know, we thought he died in a fire

346
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,110
就死于双峰镇外一座政府设施的
in that government facility outside Twin Peaks...

347
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,270
大火之中了
25 years ago.

348
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,690
那时他跟这个男人年龄差不多
About the age this man is now.

349
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,240
想想这个
Well, consider this.

350
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,710
库柏认识布里格斯
Cooper knew Briggs.

351
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,410
库柏在25年前就在布里格斯附近
Cooper was around Briggs 25 years ago,

352
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,390
现在  库柏就在这里出现了
and now, Cooper shows up in this neck of the woods.

353
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,730
在这里逍遥法外
On the loose in this neck of the woods.

354
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,780
没错
Right.

355
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,750
我在他胃里发现了这个
And I found this in his stomach.

356
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,460
它  它刻了字
It... it's inscribed.

357
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,340
上面写着  给道吉
It says, "To Dougie,

358
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,130
爱你  珍妮·E
love, Janey-E."

359
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,210
我们得跟这个威廉·黑斯廷斯谈谈
We need to speak with this William Hastings.

360
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:14,100
我不是你的脚

361
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,640
滚开
Go away!

362
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,080
露西
Hey, Lucy.

363
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,900
杜鲁门警长  我不在这儿
Sheriff Truman, I'm not here.

364
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,100
我正在午休时间
I'm on my lunch break.

365
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,850
警长
Oh, Sheriff. Oh.

366
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,590
会议室里不能吃饭  查德
No lunch in the conference room, Chad.

367
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,230
我知道  但是
I know, but...

368
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,810
你们经常在这儿喝咖啡吃面包圈啊
you guys have donuts and coffee in here all the time.

369
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,680
查德  带上你的午饭到午餐室去吃
Chad, take your lunch to the lunchroom.

370
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,780
好的
Sure thing.

371
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,860
没问题  警长
No problem, Sheriff.

372
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,180
很抱歉
Sorry.

373
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,730
下次不会了
Won't happen again.

374
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,190
能帮我开一下门吗
Could you get the door?

375
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,780
帮个忙
Little help here?

376
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,500
博比  打开窗户
Bobby, open the window.

377
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,870
好
Yeah.

378
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,140
没有接线
No seams.

379
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,630
没有开口
No openings.

380
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,060
这玩意要怎么开
How the heck are you supposed to open this thing?

381
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,240
也许哪里有个隐藏按钮
Maybe there's a hidden button somewhere.

382
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,180
我没看到什么隐藏按钮
I don't see any hidden button.

383
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,200
你在笑什么
What are you smiling at?

384
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,390
我不知道该怎么开
I know how to open that.

385
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,850
我爸爸有一点晚上带回家的
My dad brought one home one night.

386
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,220
你在逗我们吗  博比
You having fun with us, Bobby?

387
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,480
算是吧
Yeah, sort of.

388
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,520
你来
Go for it.

389
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,620
我们得回到外面去
We got to go back outside.

390
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,930
外面
Outside?

391
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,200
没错  我们得回到外面去
Yeah, we got to go back outside.

392
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,250
好吧
Okay.

393
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,800
怎么...
What the...

394
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,580
"杰克兔子的宫殿往东
"Two hundred fifty-three yards

395
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,380
253码
east of Jack Rabbit's Palace.

396
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,860
离开杰克兔子的宫殿前
Before leaving Jack Rabbit's Palace,

397
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,820
捧一把土放在
put some soil from that area

398
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,300
口袋里"
in your pocket."

399
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,320
两个日期
And two dates.

400
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,890
和一个时间
And a time.

401
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,900
同样的时间
Same time.

402
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,770
两点五十三分
2:53.

403
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,710
那是两天后
That's two days from now,

404
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,410
和三天后
and the day after.

405
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,530
杰克兔子的宫殿
Jack Rabbit's Palace?

406
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,420
我从来没听说过这个地方
I never heard of such a place.

407
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,100
他又来了
He did it again.

408
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,650
什么
What?

409
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,250
怎么回事  博比
What is it, Bobby?

410
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,180
我知道兔子杰克的宫殿在哪里
I know exactly where Jack Rabbit's Palace is.

411
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,830
我爸爸在我小时候
My dad, when I was a little kid,

412
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,390
带我去过这个地方
he took me to this place.

413
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,950
离我们的老警局很近
It was near where our station used to be.

414
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,060
是我们的奇迹之地
It was our make-believe world,

415
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,090
我们会在那里编故事
you know, where we made up stories.

416
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,730
是我叫那里杰克兔子的宫殿
I was the one who named it Jack Rabbit's Palace.

417
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,370
他预料到了这一切
He saw all this.

418
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,850
不管是怎么回事
Whatever this is.

419
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,430
我爸爸就是这样
That's my dad.

420
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,510
我们两天后去那里
We'll go up there two days from now,

421
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,680
你可以带路
and you can lead the way,

422
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,680
就想你爸爸想要的一样
just as your dad wanted.

423
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,530
等等
Wait a minute.

424
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,830
还有别的
There's something else.

425
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,310
库柏/库柏
"Cooper/cooper."

426
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,530
两个库柏
Two Coopers.

427
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,670
我们来陪你  戴安
We came out to join you, Diane,

428
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,750
艾伯特不舒服
while Albert's indisposed.

429
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,570
戈登
Gordon.

430
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,580
我们以前那个时候  经常一起抽烟
We used to smoke together, way back when.

431
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,920
你还记得吗
You remember?

432
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,570
当然了  戈登
Yeah, we sure did, Gordon.

433
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,960
当然了
We sure did.

434
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,280
谢谢你  戴安
Thanks, Diane.

435
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,500
不想抽完吗
You don's want to finish it off?

436
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,530
塔米
Tammy.

437
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,040
你好  黑斯廷斯先生
Hello, Mr. Hastings.

438
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,810
我是联调局的塔米·普雷斯顿探员
I'm Agent Tammy Preston of the FBI.

439
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,530
天啊  联调局
Oh, God, the FBI.

440
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,910
黑斯廷斯先生
Mr. Hastings,

441
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,470
我们的对话将被录像
I'm also recording our conversation.

442
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,230
好
Okay.

443
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,970
你能说出你的名字和年龄以供记录吗

字幕

446
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,890
黑斯廷斯先生  你是网上

447
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,430
一个叫《区域搜索》的

文章作者或博客主吗

449
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,960
是的
Uh-huh. Yes.

450
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,840
你都写些什么
What sort of things do you write about?

451
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,850
各种东西
Different things.

452
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,260
两周前
Approximately two weeks ago,

453
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,280
你是不是写道发现了
did you write an entry about encountering

454
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,550
所谓其他维度的入口
what you described as an alternate reality?

455
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,860
不同的维度
A different dimension.

456
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,050
是的  但这是真的
Yes, but it's real.

457
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,120
都是真的
It's all real.

458
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,530
你关注这类话题多久了  黑斯廷斯先生
How long have you been interested in this subject, Mr. Hastings?

459
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,070
很多年
Many years.

460
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,110
我...我读过很多
I do... I do a lot of reading.

461
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,840
但这一次  你写道你终于找到
But this time, you wrote that you actually found

462
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,480
并进入了这个地方
and entered such a place.

463
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,920
是的
Yes.

464
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,590
在这个地方
And that while in this place,

465
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,270
你写道  原文是
you wrote, and I quote,

466
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,250
"遇到了少校"
"We met the Major."

467
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,490
是的
Yeah. Yes.

468
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,920
露丝很擅长
You see, Ruth was very good at...

469
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,860
恢复隐藏记录
uncovering hidden records.

470
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,470
她说过如果我们在特定的时间
And she had indications that if we went to a certain place

471
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,940
去特定的地方
at a certain time,

472
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,400
就能进入那个维度
we would enter the dimension

473
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,740
就能和某个人取得联系
and make contact with a certain person.

474
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,460
我们就去了那里
And so we went there.

475
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,920
你们就在那里找到了上校
And that's where you found the Major.

476
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,060
他躲在那里
He was hiding there,

477
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,870
或者如他所说是"蛰伏"
or "Hibernating," As he said.

478
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,320
其他人可能...
And other people may...

479
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,120
可能会找到他
Were maybe gonna find him,

480
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,800
他想去其他地方
and he wanted to go to a different place,

481
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,780
所以他要我们给他找到数字
and so he asked us to get him numbers.

482
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,340
很重要的数字
Important numbers.

483
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,330
坐标
Coordinates.

484
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,340
我们在他要我们去的地方找到了
And we found them in the place he told us to go,

485
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,390
一个秘密军事基地
a secure military database.

486
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,120
那些坐标还在你这吗
Do you still have those coordinates?

487
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,250
不  在露丝那儿
No, Ruth had them.

488
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,230
她写在她的手上了
She wrote on her hand, though,

489
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,240
这样她就不会忘了
so that she wouldn't forget.

490
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,110
抱歉
Sorry.

491
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,930
然后呢  威廉
What happened then, William?

492
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,120
我们上周四把数字都给他了
We brought him back the numbers last Thursday.

493
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,470
然后发生了很可怕的事
And then something terrible happened.

494
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:49,790
那些人
These others...

495
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,190
那些人进来了
These others came in,

496
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,900
他们抓着我的脖子
and they grabbed me by the neck,

497
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,860
然后把我...把我推倒
and they pushed... They pushed me down.

498
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,710
他们说"你妻子叫什么"
They said, "What's your wife's name?

499
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,710
"你妻子叫什么"
"What's your wife's name?"

500
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,270
我说"菲莉斯"
"Phyllis," I said.

501
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,160
我没有杀露丝
I didn't kill Ruth.

502
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,300
我没有杀她
I didn't kill her.

503
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,880
你...你得相信我
You... you have to believe me.

504
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,990
我爱她
I loved her.

505
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,900
都是我的错
This is all my fault.

506
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,390
都是我的错
This is all my fault.

507
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,810
不该发生这种事的
It never should have happened.

508
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,340
威廉  我给你看的这六张照片里
William, are any of these six photographs I'm showing you

509
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,000
有你称为上校的人吗
the man you call the Major?

510
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,480
那就是上校
That's the Major.

511
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,930
在你指认为上校的人照片上画个圈
Draw a circle around the photo of the man you call the Major.

512
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,230
签字并署上日期
Sign and date it.

513
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,940
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

514
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,700
你能告诉我发生了什么吗
Can you tell me what happened?

515
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,840
我们把坐标给他
We gave him the numbers.

516
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,610
他开始飘起来
And he started to float up...

517
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,820
他说了一些词
and he said some words.

518
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,170
"库柏  库柏"
"Cooper. Cooper."

519
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,900
然后他就消失了
Right before his head disappeared.

520
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:34,080
好像根本就没存在过似的
It was something like no one has ever seen before.

521
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,020
我从来没见过这种事
I've never seen anything like it.

522
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,670
我...我从来没...我...
I... I've never... I've...

523
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,910
我从来没见过这种事
I've never read anything like it.

524
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,610
你都不知道  你不在场
You don't know. You weren't there.

525
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,110
那...他...
It was... he...

526
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,070
他...
He...

527
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,280
太美了...
It was beautiful.

528
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,210
然后露丝死了...
And then Ruth was dead.

太可怕了
It was so terrible,

530
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,850
我...我得抱着她
and I had... I had to hold her.

531
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,990
然后...然后我醒了
And then... and then I woke up,

532
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:10,180
我...我就在家里
and I was in... I was in my home.

533
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,510
我在家里
I was in my home.

534
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,450
上校杀了露丝吗
Did the Major kill Ruth?

535
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,880
不  那里有很多人
No, there were so many people there.

536
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,940
你要相信我

537
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,700
求你了  我没有杀露丝

538

我不知道我怎么了

540
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,260
你们为什么不能帮我  求你们了
Why can't you help me, please?

541
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,520
求你们了

542
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,920
我们一起很快乐

00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:48,310
在沙滩上喝鸡尾酒

547
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,610
我们本来要一起日光浴

保安什么都没找到

他们里里外外都找遍了

585
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,290
上汉堡能有什么问题

589
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,140
街对面
Across the fucking street,

590
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,700
上汉堡
serving burgers.

591
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,950
该死
Oh, shit.

592
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,700
你有看到那企鹅吗
Have you seen that penguin?

593
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,810
我...什么
Have I... what?

594
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,300
你知道的  企鹅
You know, the penguin.

595
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,310
是
Yep.

596
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,980
*我看着他们的脸*
*At their faces I'm looking*

597
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,850
*但我跟随着你的步伐*

598
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:05,010
*在你带领的道路上*

599

*我不想失去自我*
*I don't want to lose myself*

600
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,020
*轻声耳语*
*It's a whisper*

601
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,880
*有趣的是*
*It's a funny thing*

602
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,650

603
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,050

607

*When your foreign eyes*

608
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,240
*追寻*
*Trace the heights*

609
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,250
*城市的高度*
*Of the city*

610
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,290
*我们呼吸着石头和云彩产生的蒸汽*
*Steaming with rocks and clouds we breathe*

611
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:51,460
-*狂野的天空*  -*对自己的身体震惊*
- *Violent skies* - *A shock to my own body*

612

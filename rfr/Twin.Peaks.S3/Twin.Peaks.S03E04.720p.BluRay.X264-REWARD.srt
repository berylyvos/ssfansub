头奖先生
Mr. Jackpots.

151
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,250
是你赢的
You won it?

152
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,740
道吉
Dougie?

153
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,490
这些钱足够付给他们了
Well, there's--there's enough here to pay them back.

154
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,120
那个...  你可以...
The-- You could--

155
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,260
我们可以...
We could...

156
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:51,650
这是我这辈子最美妙  最可怕的一天了
This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.

157
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,050
我这辈子
Of my life.

158
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,780
是的
Yes.

159
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,150
我给你做个三明治
I'm gonna fix you a sandwich,

160
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,870
然后我再给你拿块
and then I'm gonna get you a piece

161
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,890
桑尼·吉姆的巧克力蛋糕
of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake,

162
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,910
我们特意为你留的
'cause we saved a piece for you.

163
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,860
好吗
Okay?

164
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,080
道吉
Oh, Dougie.

165
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,630
你回家我真是太高兴了  道吉
I'm so glad you're home, Dougie.

166
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,270
家
Home.

167
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,580
秘书长一会儿就来会见你
The chief of staff will be with you in a moment.

168
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,700
她在哪儿
Where is she?

169
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,250
在开会  马上就结束了
In a meeting. She's just finishing up.

170
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,750
好的  比尔
Okay, Bill.

171
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,010
-玛莎最近好吗  -挺好的
- How's Martha? - Oh, she's fine.

172
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,240
谢谢你  戈登
Thank you, Gordon.

173
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,360
她和保罗的那码事解决了吗
She ever fix that thing with Paul?

174
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,350
解决了  解决了
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

175
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,830
谢谢你还记得
Good of you to remember.

176
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,540
保罗现在在北极了
Paul is now in the North Pole.

177
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,750
真好
Well, there you go.

178
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,160
请坐吧
Please, have a seat.

179
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,430
谢谢你  比尔
Thank you, Bill.

180
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,840
丹妮斯
Denise.

181
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,650
戈登
Gordon.

182
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,460
谢谢你过来  有什么情况吗
Thank you for coming in. What have you got?

183
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,660
是库柏
It's Cooper.

184
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,090
我们找到他了
We found him.

185
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,790
在哪里
Where?

186
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,640
南达科他州  丹妮斯
South Dakota, Denise.

187
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,760
他在南达科他州的一个联邦监狱里
He's in a federal prison in South Dakota.

188
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,710
我们明天就去见他
We're going out to see him tomorrow.

189
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,720
我听说了
I heard.

190
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,500
是吗  怎样
Yes? How's that?

191
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,530
你要带普雷斯顿探员和你一起去吗
You're taking Agent Preston with you?

192
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,470
没错
Yes.

193
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,190
不是吧  戈登
Really, Gordon?

194
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,490
你这是什么意思  丹妮斯
What are you getting at, Denise?

195
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,460
我了解你  戈登
Well, I know your profile, Gordon.

196
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,050
漂亮的女探员  不到30岁
Beautiful agent, barely 30.

197
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
我作风很老派的  丹妮斯  你心里清楚
I'm old-school, Denise. You know that.

198
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,780
在你变成丹妮斯之前
Before you were Denise,

199
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,980
那时你还是丹尼斯  而我是你的上司
when you were Dennis and I was your boss,

200
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,380
我让你去缉毒局卧底的时候
when I had you working undercover at the DEA,

201
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:32,080
你有时真是又迷糊又狂野
you were a confused and wild thing sometimes.

202
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,280
我手里关于你的黑料足以填平大峡谷了
I had enough dirt on you to fill the Grand Canyon,

203
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,300
但我从来没有利用过那些黑料
and I never used a spoonful

204
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,960
因为你当时和如今都是个好探员
because you were and are a great agent.

205
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,580
你变成丹妮斯的时候
And when you became Denise,

206
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,100
我放话给你那些同事  那些跳梁小丑
I told all of your colleagues, those clown comics,

207
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,060
要么接受你  要么就去死
to fix their hearts or die.

208
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,110
没错  就像我之前多次说过的那样  戈登
Yes, and as I've said many times before, Gordon,

209
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,610
我永远也报答不完你对我的恩情
I can never repay you enough for that kindness.

210
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,400
塔米·普雷斯顿探员有这个能力  丹妮斯
Agent Tammy Preston has the stuff, Denise.

211
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,320
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

212
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,090
我现在是以一个女人的身份在讲话
I'm speaking more as a woman now

213
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,480
而不是整个联邦调查局的秘书长
than as the chief of staff of the entire federal Bureau of Investigation.

214
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,610
你有时会不会很享受
Don't you just love sometimes saying

215
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,390
像那样一口气说出
"Federal Bureau of Investigation"

216
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,140
"联邦调查局"
like that all at once?

217
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,200
不省略一个字
Unabbreviated?

218
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,500
这样真是让我兴奋极了
It just gives me such a thrill.

219
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,540
是很让人兴奋  丹妮斯
It is thrilling, Denise.

220
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,240
塔米她...
And Tammy...

221
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,760
塔米真是太漂亮了
Tammy is so beautiful.

222
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,880
联邦调查局里容得下
There's room in this Federal Bureau of Investigation

223
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,020
不止一个漂亮女人
for more than one beautiful woman.

224
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,570
戈登
Oh, Gordon.

225
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,110
这话真是太甜了
That is so sweet.

226
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,300
平时我是不能像这样思考的
You know, normally, I can't think like this.

227
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,920
在这个工作上我得摒弃那些念头  作风铁腕
I have to forgo all that and grow balls of steel to do this job,

228
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,210
而那真的是...很烦人
and it's--it's a bitch,

229
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,250
我告诉你有时候真的是的
let me tell you, sometimes--

230
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,470
更别提我体内咆哮着的荷尔蒙
not to mention the screaming hormones.

231
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,680
我明白  抱歉  戈登
I know. I'm sorry, Gordon.

232
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,670
我明白
I know.

233
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,420
戈登  我信任你
Gordon, I trust you.

234
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,360
你是知道的
You know that.

235
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,090
我觉得你是在追查某件大事
And I believe you're on the trail of something big.

236
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,720
大事
Big.

237
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,420
艾伯特会和你一起去吗
Will Albert be with you?

238
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,130
鸟儿会飞吗
Do birds fly?

239
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560
祝你好运
Good luck.

240
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,800
收到  好伙计
Ten-four, good buddy.

241
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,710
谢谢你  比尔
Thank you, Bill.

242
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,370
请跟我来
Please come along.

243
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,250
双峰镇警察局

244
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,670
这和恒温器有关
Well, it has to do with the thermostat.

245
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,460
没人的时候
It doesn't actually tell you what's going on

246
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,510
这玩意没法告诉你发生了什么事
when no one's here.

247
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,940
大部分时候  我们没有犯人
Uh, mostly, we don't have prisoners,

248
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,660
但就算我们有
but even if we did,

249
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,610
他们甚至都看不见这个恒温器
they couldn't even see the thermostat.

250
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,910
所以我最近找了个人看着炉子
So I had a man out here recently to look at the furnace,

251
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,510
结果啊  杜鲁门警长
and, Sheriff Truman,

252
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,280
他也不肯回答我
he wouldn't answer any of my questions

253
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,540
这里无人时是什么情形
about what happens when no one's here.

254
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,290
我们来的早  暖气是开着的
We come in early, and the heat is still on.

255
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,360
如果我们来的更早呢
What if we came in even earlier?

256
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,990
暖气也会是开着的吗
Would the heat still be on then?

257
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,610
你在很大声的河流边吗  杜鲁门警长
Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman?

258
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,340
你声音断断续续的
You're breaking up.

259
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,350
你还在钓鱼吗
Are you still fishing?

260
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,750
你旁边河流是不是很吵
Are you next to a really loud stream?

261
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,750
你断断续续的  警长
You're breaking up, Sheriff.

262
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,900
希望等你回到办公室
Well, I-I hope we can get this sorted out

263
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,600
我们能把这事搞清楚
when you get back to the office,

264
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,830
但现在这里很舒适
but right now, it's very comfortable in here.

265
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,620
我得挂了  杜鲁门警长  因为现在
I have to go, Sheriff Truman, because there are some people

266
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,690
有人从前门进来了
coming in through the front door.

267
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,350
露西  露西
Lucy. Lucy.

268
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,660
你刚刚又在和她讲电话  对吧
You were on the phone with her again, weren't you?

269
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,620
安迪  很抱歉  我们信号中断了
Andy, I'm sorry. We lost connection.

270
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,860
我总不能在停车场里站一整晚吧
I couldn't stand out in the parking lot all night.

271
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,010
我恨手机
I hate cellular phones.

272
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,760
这怎么可能
How is this possible?

273
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,980
露西  把电话挂了
Lucy, hang up the phone.

274
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,250
但你在山上
But you're in the mountains...

275
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,830
钓鱼啊
fishing!

276
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,640
乖乖
Oh, punky.

277
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,930
乖乖
Punky.

278
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,240
1171  1507
Eleven seventy-one. Fifteen oh-seven.

279
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,850
104
Ten-four.

280
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,710
610  1007
Six ten. Ten oh-seven.

281
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,610
收到
Copy that.

282
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,760
你好  警长
Oh, hi, Sheriff.

283
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,480
晚上好  玛吉
Evening, Maggie.

284
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,410
今晚有什么状况
What's going on tonight?

285
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,440
挺平静的
Kind of quiet.

286
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,710
一起家庭纠纷  两件酒后闹事  一个酒驾
A domestic, two D&Ds, and a DUI.

287
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,940
那个是我办的
I booked that one.

288
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,400
他酒测值0.25
Dude blew a .250.

289
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,810
连鼻子都找不到了  更别说要摸鼻子
Could not even find his nose, let alone touch it.

290
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,910
还有件很糟糕的
Oh, and it was terrible.

291
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,820
有个男孩在高中药物过量
A boy OD'd at the high school--

292
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,270
丹尼斯·克雷格
Dennis Craig.

293
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,260
安迪接的案子
Andy took the case.

294
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,010
他和家长谈过了
He spoke with the parents.

295
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,920
小丹尼·克雷格
Little Denny Craig.

296
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,450
放学钟声响了
When the bell rang,

297
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,130
他却再也没离开他书桌
he never got up from his desk.

298
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,630
霍克人呢
Where's Hawk?

299
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,260
他在会议室
He's in the conference room.

300
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,580
各位
Gents.

301
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,990
博比
Bobby.

302
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,120
又一起明显药物过量
Another apparent OD--

303
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,010
小丹尼·克雷格
little Denny Craig,

304
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,500
虽然我还没看验尸报告
although I haven't seen the autopsy report.

305
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,110
我猜
I'm guessing it was...

306
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,590
又是中国来的特制药物
Chinese designer drugs again.

307
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,800
你的监控摄像有录到什么吗
Anything on your surveillance cameras?

308
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,870
各种鹿啊
Uh, elk, deer,

309
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,320
浣熊  松鼠
raccoon, squirrel,

310
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,770
还有只熊
and a bear.

311
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,400
如果他们是从加拿大来到这里的
If they're coming down from Canada in our area,

312
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,170
我应该会看到
I would've seen them.

313
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,460
-每条路线都有我守着  -已知的路线
- I got every trail covered. - Every known trail.

314
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,730
对
Right.

315
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,980
弗兰克  我尿很急
Frank, I got to take a leak so bad,

316
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,720
都快满到嘴里了
my back teeth are floatin'.

317
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,060
回头会议室见
Meet you in the conference room.

318
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,330
太好了  长官
Good deal, sir.

319
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,290
手机
Cell phones...

320
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,350
代表它们能随身携带
that means they're mobile, punky.

321
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,500
警长可能在移动中
The sheriff can be moving.

322
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,900
不像你的电话
It's not like your phone.

323
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,980
他说话的同时可能正在移动
He can be moving and even driving

324
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,530
甚至在开车
while he's talking.

325
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,320
露西
Lucy...

326
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,430
你工作各方面
you're so good at your job

327
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,030
都非常能干
in every other way.

328
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,760
我就不明白为什么这情况
I just don't understand how this keeps happening...

329
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,000
老是发生
over and over again.

330
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,380
我也不明白  安迪
I don't understand it either, Andy.

331
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,380
你休息一下
You collect yourself.

332
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,640
我要去见杜鲁门警长
I've got to go see Sheriff Truman.

333
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
我知道她这人有点奇怪
I know she seems like a strange one,

334
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,490
但她提供的信息都是正确的
but her information has always been spot-on.

335
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,030
那么
So...

336
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,980
玛格丽特说
Margaret says

337
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,620
有样跟戴尔·库柏特工有关的东西
that something is missing

338
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,950
不见了
having to do with Special Agent Dale Cooper

339
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,880
而这东西只有你能找到
and only you can find...

340
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,120
因为这东西跟你的遗产有关
because of something about your heritage.

341
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,010
她就说了这些
That's what she said.

342
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,050
我来了  杜鲁门警长
I'm here, Sheriff Truman.

343
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,340
好  安迪
Good, Andy.

344
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,200
我感觉好点了  杜鲁门警长
I'm feeling a bit better now, Sheriff Truman.

345
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,620
我以为这抱木头的女人精神有问题
I thought that log woman was 10-96

346
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,650
是不允许在这楼里的
and not even allowed in this building.

347
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,210
那是一种口香糖
That's on account of a kind of gum.

348
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,080
我会尝尝的
Well, I'll chew on that.

349
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,700
够了  查德
That's enough, Chad.

350
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,150
她的木头会告诉她信息
She gets messages from her log.

351
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,030
匹诺曹的朋友
Pinocchio's friend.

352
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,120
晚安  查德
Good night, Chad.

353
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,390
我要去跟我的小松果聊聊
I'll go have a word with my pinecone.

354
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,950
劳拉·帕尔默
Laura Palmer?

355
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,460
天啊
Man...

356
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,060
记忆涌现
brings back some memories.

357
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,430
抱歉
Sorry.

358
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,340
这都是些什么
What's all this about?

359
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,010
从玛格丽特·兰特曼到霍克
Message from Margaret Lanterman to Hawk

360
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,290
关于库柏探员的信息
concerning Agent Cooper.

361
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,480
库柏
Cooper?

362
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,180
特工戴尔·库柏
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

363
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,470
我知道是谁
Yeah, I know.

364
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,570
库柏是我父亲生前最后见的一个人
Cooper was the last person to see my father alive.

365
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,720
怎么回事
What's that?

366
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,380
在我父亲去世后几天
Yeah. A few days after my dad died,

367
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,360
我母亲告诉我库柏来过我们家
my mom told me that Cooper had come by the house

368
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,190
跟我父亲聊过
and talked to my dad,

369
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,620
我猜库柏在那之后就很快地离开了小镇
and I guess Cooper left town

370
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,190
我也不清楚
pretty soon after that. I don't--

371
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,170
在那之后就没有人见过或听说过他
Nobody's seen or heard of him since.

372
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,130
第二天  我父亲死于他局里发生的火灾
And my dad died in the fire at his station the next day.

373
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,560
你知道他们的聊天内容吗
And do you know what they talked about?

374
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,520
不  不
Uh, no. No.

375
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,210
我不知道
I have no idea.

376
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,350
有个男人来了
There's a man out front.

377
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,090
他说他叫沃利·白兰度
He says his name is Wally Brando.

378
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,310
沃利  沃利来了
Wally? Wally's here?

379
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,850
他们的儿子
Their son.

380
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,670
他说他想来向你表达敬意
He said he wants to pay his respects to you,

381
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,070
杜鲁门警长
Sheriff Truman.

382
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,680
这孩子
Oh, boy.

383
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,770
杜鲁门警长  看谁来了
Sheriff Truman, look who's here!

384
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,340
是沃利  我们太兴奋了  完全是惊喜啊
It's Wally. We're so excited. He came in unannounced.

385
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,300
很高兴再见到你  沃利
Good to see you again, Wally.

386
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,780
我也是  杜鲁门警长
It's good to see you, too, Sheriff Truman.

387
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,280
你也知道  你的哥哥  哈里·S·杜鲁门
As you know, your brother, Harry S. Truman,

388
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,250
是我的教父
is my godfather.

389
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,930
我听说他生病了
I heard he is ill.

390
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,020
我来是想向我的教父表达敬意的
I came to pay my respects to my godfather

391
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,830
还有向他表达我的祝福
and extend my best wishes for his recovery,

392
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,660
希望他能早日康复
which I hope will be swift and painless.

393
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,860
很荣幸能再次见到你
It's an honor to see you again.

394
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,270
你知道的
You know...

395
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,710
我一直支持你
my heart is always here with you

396
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,680
还有这两个善良的人
and these fine people, my parents,

397
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,700
我深爱着的父母
who I love so dearly.

398
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,870
而且我就在附近
And I was in the area,

399
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,120
我想来关心一下
and I wanted to pay my respects.

400
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,910
谢谢你  沃利
Thank you, Wally.

401
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,090
我来也是先让我父母知道
I also came back to let my parents know,

402
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,740
因为这一直是他们非常担心的问题
because this has been a matter of grave concern for them,

403
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,150
我决定了
that I've decided to let them do what they wish

404
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,670
让他们改造我儿时的房间
with my childhood bedroom.

405
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,170
他们想
They want to--

406
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,350
他们想建个书房
they want to build a study

407
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,870
给他们自己
for the two of them.

408
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,290
多贴心的人
Such sweet people.

409
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,870
这真是个好消息  沃利
That's such beautiful news, Wally.

410
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,820
跟我们说说你都去哪里了  沃利
Tell us where you've been, Wally.

411
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,150
我的家人  我的朋友
My family, my friend...

412
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,040
我在我们这块伟大的土地上
I've crisscrossed this great land of ours

413
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,400
纵横穿越好多次
countless times.

414
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,820
地图已经深深刻在我的心中
I hold the map of it here, in my heart...

415
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,890
和我小时候
next to the joyful memories

416
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,630
在这座美丽的
of the carefree days I spent

417
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,710
双峰镇
as a young boy...

418
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,500
度过的快乐回忆一起
here in your beautiful town of Twin Peaks.

419
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,300
从维吉尼亚州亚历山大
From Alexandria, Virginia,

420
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,610
到加州斯托克顿
to Stockton, California,

421
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,610
我想到路易斯
I think about Lewis

422
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,590
和他的朋友克拉克
and his friend Clark,

423
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,100
第一个看到这里的白种人
the first Caucasians to see this part of the world.

424
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,790
在我的旅途中  他们的足迹
Their footsteps have been the highways and byways

425
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,810
无处不在
of my days on the road.

426
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,360
我和我的影子同行
My shadow is always with me.

427
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,760
有时它在我前头
Sometimes ahead.

428
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,450
有时它跟在我后面
Sometimes behind.

429
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,170
有时在左边
Sometimes to the left.

430
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,210
有时在右边
Sometimes to the right.

431
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,880
除了阴天
Except on cloudy days...

432
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,910
或晚上
or at night.

433
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,460
好
Yes.

434
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,960
沃利

愿你的车轮驶遍所有道路

你

448
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,640
被

449
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,020
骗了

450
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,540
现在

451
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,370

457
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,430

只能带到干洗店

469
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,570
看看能不能换一套

470
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,070
好吧  你自己系领带
Okay. You do your tie.

471
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,950
我总是打不好

这么些年
all these years,

540
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,270
主要和我们的同事

我得向你

我会告诉你整个故事

所有的迂回曲折
all its twists and turns,

547
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,910
我本来也正准备这么做

我在向你汇报的路上

比计划日程稍晚了些
I was a little bit behind schedule

550
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,800
当我的车在转向
when my car veered over

551
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,790
冲出了马路
across the road,

发生了事故

比计划日程稍晚了些
I was a little bit behind schedule

557
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,770
当我的车在转向时冲出了马路

558
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,390
发生了事故
and I had my accident.

559
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,450
我留信息了
I've left messages.

560
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,670
什么信息  小库
What messages were those, Coop?

561
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:42,320
我留了信息  这样菲利普就知道是安全的
Messages so Phillip knows it's safe.

562
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,090
戈登
Gordon?

563
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,310
你准备什么时候把我弄出去
When are you going to get me out of here?

564
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,030
小库  这里的这些同事
Coop, these fine fellows here

565
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,210
现在有足够的理由扣押你
have sufficient cause to hold you for now.

566
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,940
当然  我会在法庭上
Of course, I will be exonerated

567
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,870
被宣判无罪的
in courts of law.

568
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,590
很好  小库
Very good, Coop.

569
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,660
别担心  我们会努力
And rest assured that we are working

570
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,130
带你回家好好聊聊的
to bring you back home for our talk.

571
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,210
我从未真正地离开过家  戈登
I've never really left home, Gordon.

572
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,020
一会见  老朋友
See you soon, old friend.

573
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,450
我们可以再扣押他两天
We can hold him for two more days

574
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,400
也无需提出指控
without filing any charges.

575
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,060
我猜你还没给他打电话
I assume you haven't given him his phone call.

576
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,520
还没
No, we haven't.

577
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,450
墨菲监狱长  我建议你
Warden Murphy, I suggest you give him

578
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,620
私下给他打个电话
his private phone call,

579
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,180
而我想听到整个过程
and I expect to hear all about it.

580
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,150
他没有去费城  他去往西边了

Albert, that sound you just made of your feet on the concrete,

621
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,340
就像是有一把刀在我脑里磨
it's like a knife in my brain.

622

对不起  戈登
I'm sorry, Gordon.

623

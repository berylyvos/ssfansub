我觉得可能要你破财了

可能  是很大一笔财

你这么觉得吗
You think so, do you?

49
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,290
是的先生  我这么觉得
Yes, sir, I do.

50

离开高速  雷
Let's get off this highway, Ray.

53
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,750
介意我在路边停一下吗
You mind if I pull over a sec?

54
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,160
我要小解
I gotta take a leak.

55
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,620
去吧
Go for it.

我要那个情报

58
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,170
什么
Yes?

59
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,110
看上去你已经花光了五十万
Looks like you're out half a million.

60
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,220
我觉得你搞错了
Well, I think you're wrong about that.

61
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,420
上当了吧  蠢货

64
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,790
我觉得他已经死了
I think he's dead,

65
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,570
但他好像得到了某种帮助
but he's found some kind of help, so

66
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,170
我不是百分之百肯定
I'm not 100 percent

67
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,770
我...
and-I----mm...

68
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,390
我看见库柏身上发生了一些事
I saw something in Cooper.

69
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,290
可能这就是一切的关键
It may be the key to what this is all about.

70
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,050
我告诉他我要去哪了
And I told him where I'm going,

71
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,630
所以如果他来找我  我会抓住他
so if he comes after me, I'll get him there.

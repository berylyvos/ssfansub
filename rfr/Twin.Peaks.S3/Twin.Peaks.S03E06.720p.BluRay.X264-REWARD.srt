75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,010
好吧  道吉

妈妈一会就上去  宝贝

赶紧下来  快点
Get down here, right now!

96
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,650
你麻烦大了  先生
You are in the doghouse, mister.

97
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,700
你本该打给他们
You were supposed to call them

98
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,180
约好时间把钱给他们
and set up a time to pay them off,

99
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,460
结果你看看  这东西出现了

Jade?

103
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,040
她叫杰德是吧

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,810
杰德载了我两程
Jade give two rides.

105
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,590
我猜也是
I'll bet she did.

106
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,080
你承认你认识她
And you admit you know her.

107
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,840
看看你俩  那样搂在一起

108
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,410

Are you gonna answer that?

109
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,910
也许是杰德打来的呢
Maybe it's Jade calling!

110
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,910
杰德
Jade.

111
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,740
我的天  道吉
Oh, my God, Dougie.

112
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,900
这事没完
We are not done with this.

113
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,470
喂

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,760
道格·琼斯

115
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,710
你是哪位
Who is this?

116
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,000
道格...琼斯
Doug...Jones.

117
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,620
他不舒服
He's indisposed.

118
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,670
你收到我们的信封了吗
Did you get our envelope?

119
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,900
是的我收到了  真是谢谢你了
Yes, I did, thank you very much.

120
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,350
现在你听我说
Now, you listen to me.

121
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,570
他欠你多少钱
How much does he owe you?

122
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,740
他跟你说了吗
Did he tell you?

123
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,510
他没跟我说过
No, he didn't tell me.

124
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,570
我也是现在才知道这事的
I'm just finding out about all this right now.

125
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,100
五万美元
Fifty thousand.

126
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,950
他怎样凑那么多钱出来
A--and how's he supposed to get that?

127
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,960
谁会有那么多钱
Who can get that kind of money?

128
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,150
如果他没有这么多钱呢
And what if he doesn't have it?

129
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,510
你打算怎么做  打断他的腿吗
What are you gonna do then? Break his legs?

130
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,470
想想吧  凑这钱已经够难了
Think about it; it's hard enough to get that kind of money,

131
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,580
你打断他的腿了就更加不可能凑到了
let alone with broken legs.

132
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,980
五万美元  到期
Fifty thousand dollars, past due.

133
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,400
我们明天打电话去他办公室的时候
It'd be real smart for Mr. Jones

134
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,140
他最好是凑足了钱
to have that on him tomorrow when we call his office.

135
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,530
别  别  不要  不要
No, no, no, no.

136
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,620
你休想去他的办公室搞事
Don't you dare go to his office.

137
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,750
我会亲自跟你谈谈
I'll talk to you myself.

138
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,330
公园里面  靠近商场那个
In the park, at the corner of Guinevere and Merlin

139
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,530
吉尼维尔和梅林的角落

140
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,290
到时我会拿着红色的手提包
I'll be the one carrying the red purse.

141
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,350
红色手提包

142
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,140
时间呢

143
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,310
明天中午十二点半
Noon-thirty tomorrow.

144
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,310
你看看你干的好事  道吉
What a mess you've made of our lives, Dougie.

145
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,430
我该拿你怎么办好
Now, what am I gonna do with you?

146
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,370
我本来打算在午饭时间
I was gonna take you to see Dr. Ben tomorrow

147
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,940
带你去看本医生的
during your lunch hour.

148
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,100
但我要在十二点半跟你朋友见面
And now I have to meet your friends at 12:30.

149
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,280
我...你的车呢  还有你钱包去哪了
I--w-where's your car? And your wallet?

很容易搞定的  不是吗
they're a pushover, right?

211
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,590
执法的人都是浑浑噩噩的
Law enforcement's asleep at the wheel.

212
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,080

Fuckin' sheriff here is like 90 years old or something.

221
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,090
还有一个问题
There's--there's one problem.

222
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,820
我还不了解你

然后吃掉你的脑花

Not much I got to look forward to at my age, Mickey,

257
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,040
每天就是等死

258
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,990
别这么说  卡尔
Don't say that, Carl.

259
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,370
你还有很长的路要走呢
You know, you got a lot of tread left.

260
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,930
琳达怎么样了
How's Linda?

261

She's doing a lot better.

262
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,810
终于要政府部门送来了
Got the government agencies to finally get

263
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,860
一台电动轮椅
one of them electric wheelchairs.

264
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,170
该死的战争
Fuckin' war.

265
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,240
政府在照顾你  是吗
So the government's taking care of you, huh?

266
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,880
没多大帮助
Not hardly.

267
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,410
我们花了六个月才要到这个轮椅
Took us about six months to get this wheelchair for her.

268
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,120
该死的政府
Fuckin' government.

269
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,560
想抽烟吗
Want a smoke?

270
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,910
想
Yeah.

271
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,110
想抽  但我已经戒烟了

戒烟
Quit?

273
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,300
是的
Yeah.

274
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,410
大约一年前就戒了
Quit about a year ago.

275
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,160
我抽了75年的烟了
I've been smoking for 75 years,

276
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,010
每天都抽
every fucking day.

277
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,550
有人路过那间商店时  我心想
So when I pass that shop, I say,

278
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,480
"不知他们有没有写了我名字的杯子蛋糕"
"Oh, I wonder if they have a cupcake with my name on it."

279
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,330
我进店一看  他们果然有
And when I go in, sure enough, they have it.

280
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,600
很神奇
It's magic.

281
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,760
我路过双R餐厅时  心想
And when I pass by the Double R, I say,

282
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,020
"不知他们有没有
"Hm, I wonder if they have

283
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,820
写了我名字的樱桃派"
a slice of cherry pie with my name on it."

284
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,630
我一进店  你们果真也有
And when I come in, sure enough, you have it.

285
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,820
今天你们有两块
Today you had two pieces of pie

286
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,960
写了我名字的派  两块我都要了
with my name on it, each one.

287
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,500
米里亚姆  我发现
Well, Miriam, it turns out

288
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,890
你是我们店有史以来的最佳买派的顾客
you're one of our best pie customers ever.

289
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,620
因为诺玛做的派最好吃
Because Norma makes the best pies.

290
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,110
那是当然
She sure does.

291
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,600
对了  我能买两杯咖啡带走吗
Oh, hey, can I get two cups of coffee to go?

292
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,190
我的那杯要低咖啡因的
One decaf for me and one regular

293
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
一杯常规的给我妈  她超爱双R餐厅的咖啡
for one of the moms who loves Double R coffee?

294
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,940
-马上来  -太好了
- Coming right up. - Excellent.

295
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,850
学校怎么样了  米里亚姆
How is school, Miriam?

296
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,070
今年学校里的孩子都很可爱
Oh, the kids this year are so cute.

297
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,600
好了  给你
Okay, here you go.

298
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,010
不用找了  给你们俩的小费
Keep the change. The tip is for you all.

299
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,560
谢谢你  米里亚姆
Oh, thank you, Miriam.

300
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,490
-谢谢你  米里亚姆  -再见
- Thank you, Miriam. - Bye.

301
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,420
她没这么阔气能给这么多小费
She can't afford to leave a tip like that.

302
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,440
我知道  可怜的人儿
I know. Poor thing.

303
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,340
但她真的很喜欢我们的派
But she just loves our pies.

304
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,250
知道吗  下次  咱们请她吃
You know what? Next time, let's treat her.

305
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,140
行啊  太好了  好主意
Oh, yeah, great. Great idea.

306
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,600
白痴耍魔术的
Stupid magic motherfucker.

307
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,340
"小子"
Ha, yeah, "kid"?

308
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,010
我要给你们看看小子的本事
I'll show you fucking kid.

309
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,120
抓住你了
Got ya.

310
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,570
什么玩意
What the fuck?

311
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,310
去他妈的
Fuck this.

312
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,660
全路禁止通行

313
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,410

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,530

315
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,910
不
Oh, no.

316
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,810
不
No.

317
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,540
天啊
Oh, God.

318
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,380
我都说了
Hey! Hey, I told you

319
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,430
不要挡我的路
to get out of the fucking way!

320
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,800
不
No.

321
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,590
天啊
God.

322
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,530
格雷戈

写下来了吗
Copy?

329
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,690
写好了
Got it.

330
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,660
道吉
Dougie?

331
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,770
道吉
Dougie.

332
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,860
道吉
Dougie.

333
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,630
快别闹了
Quit clowning around.

334
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,420
道吉
Dougie--

335
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,490
道吉

336
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,350
道吉
Dougie.

337
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,330
快过来
Come on.

338
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,790

00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,550
道吉
Dougie!

342
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,470
到我办公室来
In my office!

343
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,110
快点
Now!

344
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,520
这都是些
What the hell

345
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,340
什么乱七八糟的简笔画
are all these childish scribbles?

346
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,000
这我怎么能看得明白
H-how am I gonna make any sense out of this?

347
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,020
看...
Make...

348
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,410
...明白
...sense of it.

349
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,820
我觉得你真该
I'm thinking you may need

350
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,710
去找专业的医生帮帮你了  道吉
some good professional help, Dougie.

351
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,120
帮帮道吉
Help Dougie.

352
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:41,700
最强硬汉
布什内尔·拳击新星·穆林斯

353
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,290
道吉
Dougie.

354
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,920
谢谢你
Thank you.

355
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,190
我希望你能不要再告诉别人
I want you to keep this information to yourself.

356
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,720
这事挺闹心的
This is disturbing.

357
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,750
也不只是闹心了
To say the least.

358
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,180
这些就交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

359
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,570
但我可能还会找你帮忙
But I may need your help again.

360
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,670
你可是又给我添了不少要办的事情啊
You've certainly given me a lot to think about.

361
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,350
办事情
Think about.

362
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,120
道吉
Dougie?

363
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:33,640
你真是...  挺有趣的
You're an-- an interesting fellow.

364
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,020
你是琼斯吗
You Jones?

365
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,950
是我  我们就直说了吧
Yes. Now let's get to it.

366
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,490
给我解释一下道吉到底干了什么
Explain to me exactly what Dougie did

367
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,160
才欠了你们的钱
to make him owe you money.

368
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,970
他借的
He borrowed it.

369
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,570
什么叫"他借的"
What do you mean, "He borrowed it"?

370
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,770
他赌了一场橄榄球赛
He took points on a football game.

371
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,610
后来胃口大了  加了双倍
He got greedy, he doubled down.

372
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,220
结果最后没赢
It didn't work out for him.

373
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,250
赔了两万  还有利息
Out 20 grand he was, plus interest.

374
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,070
这已经是三周前的事了
Now, that was three weeks ago.

375
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,070
利息还在加呢
Meter's still running.

376
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,750
已经涨到五万二了
It's up to 52.

377
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,030
先让我来捋一捋  有这么一场球赛
So let me get this straight. People were playing games.

378
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,300
他打了个赌输了两万
He made a bet where he lost $20,000.

379
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,240
然后你们想让他给五万二
But you want him to pay you back $52,000?

380
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,530
没错  是这样的
Very good. That's correct.

381
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,150
好吧  那你们听清楚了
Okay, so you get this straight.

382
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,160
我的丈夫有份工作  结了婚
My husband has a job; he has a wife;

383
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,150
还有个孩子  他挣的钱根本
he has a child; he does not make enough money

384
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,020
拿不出五万二  不管是干什么
to pay back $52,000 for anything.

385
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,140
我们算不上有钱
We are not wealthy people.

386
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,860
开的都是廉价的破车
We drive cheap, terrible cars.

387
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,450
我们就是些平民百姓
We are the 99 percenters.

388
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,700
我们已经被欺负的够多了
And we are shit on enough.

389
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,220
但我们绝对忍不了再听任
And we are certainly not gonna be shit on

390
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,380
你们这种人摆布
by the likes of you.

391
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,830
不过  女士...
Nevertheless, lady...

392
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,930
所以我们就这么办了
So here's what we're gonna do.

393
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,680
在我不知情的情况下  我丈夫找你们
Without my knowledge, my husband came to you

394
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,340
借了两万
for a loan of $20,000.

395
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,860
你们也很好心的借给他了
You were nice enough to give it to him.

396
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,920
但他决不该像这个样子赌钱
But he should never have been gambling like that.

397
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,170
我会把钱还给你们的
I'm gonna pay you back.

398
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:04,530
不过在银行里  我们就只挣
Now, at my bank, where we make

399
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,060
不到百分之一的利息
less than one percent interest

400
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,780
原本存的钱也不多
on what little money we have,

401
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,320
你借钱能要到百分之二十五的利息
people would be turning cartwheels

402
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,720
就该高兴到翻跟头了
just to get 25 percent interest on any loan,

403
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,100
这些就是我现在很大方的
and that is what I'm generously

404
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,340
准备给你们的数
gonna give to you right now,

405
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,150
两万五千块
$25,000.

406
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,850
这些就是我第一次  也是最后一次
That is my first, last,

407
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,750
会给你们的全部的钱  仅此一次
and only offer to you.

408
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,530
这究竟是个什么世道
What kind of world are we living in

409
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,930
才会有你们这种人
where people can behave like this?

410
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,040
竟能这个样子对别人
Treat other people this way

411
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,440
毫无恻隐之情
without any compassion

412
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,750
也不体谅他人的痛苦
or feeling for their suffering?

413
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,990
我们生存在一个无比黑暗的年代
We are living in a dark, dark age,

414
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,540
而你们
and you

415
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,450
也是问题根源的一部分
are part of the problem.

416
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,350
我建议你们好好看看你们自己
Now, I suggest you take a good, long look at yourselves

417
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,420
因为我再也不想看到你们了
because I never want to see either of you again.

418
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,130
这小妞真狠
Tough dame.

419
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,100
真狠
Tough.

420
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,660
什么叫他不在车里  三具尸体
What do you mean he wasn't in the car? Three bodies?

421
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,400
不
Oh, no.

422
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,380
操
Fuck!

423
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,300
奈兹·珀斯制造

424
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,080
你干什么
The hell?

425
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,480
上女厕所  查德
Use the ladies' room, Chad.

426
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,690
你在干什么
The hell are you doing?

427
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,950
拜托  查德
Please, Chad,

428
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,840
去别的隔间上厕所
use another restroom.

429
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,520
你和警长说过了吗
Clear this with the sheriff?

430
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,840
你不说的话我说
I'll tell him if you don't.

431
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,310
去说吧  查德
Yeah, you do that, Chad.

432
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,540
写报告一点都没意思  伙计们
Filling out paperwork's no fun, fellows.

433
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,500
我知道  但是总得写
I know that, but, uh, gotta be done.

434
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,350
等你做完...这堆破事
And when you finish... That motherfucking piece of shit.

435
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,920
我要你处理...
...I want you to handle that...

436
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,170
惊喜吧  惊喜吧
Well, surprise, surprise!

437
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:19,000
没有修好
It's not fixed!

438
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,090
怎么了  多丽丝
What's that, Doris?

439
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,630
爸爸的车
Dad's car.

440
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,120
今天早上他要开
This morning he went to drive,

441
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,510
根本开不出车道  弗兰克
couldn't even get it out of the driveway, Frank!

442
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,660
只会一晃一晃
It just lurched and lurched.

443
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,780
他应该没有放手刹吧
Sounds like he left the emergency brake on.

444
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,360
你是说我爸爸不知道怎么开车吗
Are you telling me my father doesn't know how to drive a car?

445
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,470
你是想说这个吗
Is that what you're telling me?

446
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,920
你别想
Don't you dare,

447
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,300
你别想把这开不了的破车
don't you dare try to blame my father

448
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,970
怪到我爸爸头上
for that car not running right!

449
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:41,550
如果能让你好受点
We'll get it looked at again

450
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,480
我们就再找人来看看
if it'll make you feel better.

451
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,930
好受点  好受点
Feel better? Feel better?

452
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,240
为什么  你为什么老和我对着干  弗兰克
Why, why are you always against me, Frank?

453
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,880
去我办公室吧
Let's go to my office.

454
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,740
他们修得太差了
They did a lousy job fixing that car.

455
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,300
他们得修好
They have to make it right,

456
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,350
不然我们就不付钱
or we're not paying them until they do!

457
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,350
换我可不会受她这种鸟气
I sure wouldn't take that kind of shit off her.

458
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,250
怎么了
What?

459
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,540
你根本不知道你自己在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

460
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,320
是吗  怎么说
Oh, yeah? How's that?

461
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,560
算了
Forget it.

462
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,900
怎么了
What's the matter?

463
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,750
这是个自由的世界
It's a free world.

464
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,770
我能表达我的观点
I can voice my opinion.

465
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,070
你当然可以
Oh, you sure can.

466
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,380
哥们儿
Oh, brother.

467
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,660
她以前不是这样的
She didn't use to be like this.

468
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,120
你不知道他们儿子自杀了吗
You didn't know that their son committed suicide?

469
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,330
我听说过
Yeah, I heard something about that.

470
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,720
他受不了成为士兵
He couldn't take being a soldier.

471
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,640
警局  有什么紧急情况
Sheriff's Department. What's your emergency?

472
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,810
你在哪里
Where's your location?

473
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,550
你电话多少

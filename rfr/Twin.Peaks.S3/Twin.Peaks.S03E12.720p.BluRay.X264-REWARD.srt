第三季 第十二集

19
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,830
谢天谢地戈登在他的酒窖里储备了刨子
Thank God Gordon stocks the plane from his own wine cellar.

20
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,260
不  你去告诉她
No, you'll be the one to tell her.

21
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,520
别理会这个怪人
Ignore the strange man.

22
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,290
-敬联调局  -敬联调局
- Here's to the bureau. - To the bureau.

23
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,790
敬联调局
To the bureau.

24
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,840
艾伯特
Albert.

25
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,690
戈登
Gordon.

26
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,180
好了  现在说说你需要知道的事
Okay, here's what you need to know.

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,130
拜托说得简洁点
Please speak succinctly,

28
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,280
别发出任何尖锐的噪音
and do not make any loud, sharp noises.

29
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,450
1970年  美国空军终止了蓝皮书计划
In 1970, the United States Air Force shut down Project Blue Book,

30
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,770
即他们对不明飞行物为期二十年的调查
their 20-year investigation into UFOs.

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,120
他们得出结论  没有可靠证据存在
They concluded that no credible evidence existed

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,450
因此他们认为不明飞行物对国家安全没有威胁
and therefore they posed no threat to national security.

33
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,740
换句话说  是个巨大的掩饰
In other words, a massive cover-up.

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,770
干杯
Cheers.

35
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,150
干杯
Cheers.

36
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,150
几年后  军方和联调局
A few years later, the military and FBI

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,350
组建了一支高度机密的特遣部队
formed a top secret task force

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,350
去探索蓝皮书没能解答的
to explore the troubling abstractions

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,610
令人不安的抽象概念
raised by cases Blue Book failed to resolve.

40
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,280
我们称之为蓝色玫瑰
We called it the Blue Rose after a phrase

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,160
这是那些案件中的一个女人
uttered by a woman in one of these cases

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,180
临死前说出的一个词
just before she died

43
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,910
暗示着我们永远无法企及这些答案
which suggested these answers could not be reached

44
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,770
除非通过我们从未踏足过的另一条途径
except by an alternate path we've been traveling ever since.

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,110
戈登推荐了一位名叫菲利普·杰弗里斯的探员
Gordon suggested an agent by the name of Phillip Jeffries

46
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,180
作为队长
to head the squad.

47
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,220
他很快招募了另外三人
He soon recruited three others:

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,690
我  切特·戴斯蒙德和戴尔·库柏
myself, Chet Desmond, and Dale Cooper.

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,390
也许你已经注意到了
Perhaps you haven't failed to notice

50
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,960
我是那组人里
that I'm the only one of that group

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,630
唯一没有无故消失的
who hasn't disappeared without explanation,

52
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,230
所以戈登也迟迟没有向我们团队中
which has led to a certain reluctance on Gordon's part

53
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,930
注入新鲜的血液
to bring new blood into the fold...

54
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,660
直至今晚
until tonight.

55
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,230
普雷斯顿探员
Agent Preston,

56
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,600
我们关注你很久了
you've been on our radar

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,590
你在华盛顿高中上了荣誉榜
since you made the honors list at George Washington High,

58
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,950
还是麻省理工的年度优秀学生
not to mention the dean's list at MIT

59
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,360
并在匡提科名列前茅
and top of your class at Quantico.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,280
你们想让我加入蓝色玫瑰特遣队
You're asking me to join the Blue Rose task force.

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,540
没错
Yep.

62
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,240
我加入
I'm in.

63
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,180
明早我跟你简单介绍具体情况
I'll brief you in detail in the morning.

64
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,920
好的
Okay.

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,920
敬塔米和蓝色玫瑰
To Tammy and the Blue Rose.

66
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,690
敬蓝色玫瑰
The Blue Rose.

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,280
敬蓝色玫瑰
The Blue Rose.

68
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,140
戴安在路上了
Diane's on her way.

69
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,680
请坐 戴安
Have a seat, Diane.

70
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,990
喝一杯吗
Care for a drink?

71
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,770
我喜欢冰镇的
I like it on the rocks.

72
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,920
你运气好
Well, you're in luck.

73
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,660
达科他还是冰天雪地的季节
The Dakotas are still in the Ice Age.

74
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,650
戴安
Diane,

75
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,220
我们你知道你跟库柏探员的合作
we know your work with Agent Cooper has given you

76
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,230
让你对蓝色玫瑰有了较深了解
more than a passing insight into the Blue Rose.

77
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,320
即便你已经不是局里的人了
Even though you're no longer a part of the bureau,

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,010
我们还是想当你的代理人
we'd like to deputize you.

79
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,080
只是暂时的
On a temporary basis,

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,420
我们真的需要你的帮助
because we really need your help.

81
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,380
我有什么好处
What's in it for me?

82
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,980
现金
Some cash.

83
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,610
不太多
Not much.

84
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,840
或许还有查清你朋友库柏
Maybe the satisfaction of learning

85
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,850
究竟遭遇了什么的满足感
what happened to your friend Cooper.

86
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,280
那就开始吧
Let's rock.

87
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,620
能给我一盒塞勒姆香波吗  谢谢
Uh, could I have a carton of Salems, please?

88
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,900
牛肉干

89
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,130
多少钱
How much is it?

90
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,960
133块7
$133.70.

91
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,010
我不记得那里之前有牛肉干
I don't remember seeing those beef jerky there before.

92
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,450
是新到的货
Uh, that's new.

93
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,350
什么口味的
What type is it?

94
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,490
是火鸡  不是牛肉
Uh, it's turkey, not beef.

95
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,960
是烟熏口味的吗
Is it smoked?

96
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,470
我猜是吧
Uh, I-I think so.

97
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,370
这个跟牛肉干是一样的
It's the same as beef jerky,

98
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,910
只不过是火鸡肉而已
except it's made from turkey.

99
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,210
第一次入这货的时候你在吗
Were you here when they first came?

100
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,780
在
Uh, yes.

101
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,140
这是他们几周前进的货
They brought it in a couple weeks ago.

102
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,710
你这里有点不对劲
Your room seems different.

103
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,390
有人来了
And men are coming.

104
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,910
我
Uh, I'm...

105
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,600
我...我不是很懂你在说什么
I'm-I'm not sure I know what you mean.

106
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,970
我在提醒你们要当心
I am trying to tell you that you have to watch out!

107
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,510
大祸将至
Things can happen!

108
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,950
曾经降临在我头上的大祸
Something happened to me.

109
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,730
曾经降临在我头上的大祸
Something happened to me!

110
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,740
我有点难受  我不舒服
I don't feel good. I don't feel good.

111
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,850
我不舒服
I don't feel good.

112
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,230
我不舒服
I don't feel good!

113
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,090
萨拉
Sarah.

114
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,740
萨拉  停...  停手
Sarah, s-stop doing this.

115
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,810
我要不要叫医生
Should-should I call a doctor?

116
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,830
停手  快停手
Stop doing this. Stop doing this.

117
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,760
好的  离开这里
Okay. Leave this place.

118
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
找车匙  找车匙
Find the car key. Find the car key.

119
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,330
拿车匙
Get the car key.

120
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,970
拿车...  快拿车匙
Get the car-- get the goddamn car key!

121
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,850
什么啊
What?

122
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,380
我...
I...

123
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,780
我知道她住哪
I know where she lives.

124
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,650
我可以把这些送过去给她
I can d-deliver them.

125
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,290
我猜
I guess.

126
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:38,220
上午九点半  不可提前  到下午五点半

127
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,480
克里斯克尔
Kriscol.

128
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,680
我想问你点事
I want to ask you something.

129
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
你又去卖血了吗
You been selling your blood again?

130
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,890
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

131
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,220
克里斯克尔
Now, Kriscol,

132
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,000
你上周是不是帮杰金斯装了煤气罐
did you install a new propane tank for Jenkins last week?

133
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,240
没错  先生
Yes, sir.

134
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,920
你有收钱吗
Did you get paid for that?

135
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,330
没有  先生
No, sir.

136
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,640
你有没有修剪和清理草坪
Do you mow lawns around here and rake up?

137
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,950
有  先生
Yes, sir.

138
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,870
那你有拿报酬吗
Do you get paid for that?

139
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,610
没有  先生
No, sir.

140
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,300
那好  克里斯克尔
Okay, Kriscol.

141
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,370
这五十美元是给你报酬
Here's 50 bucks for the work.

142
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,950
还有  你这个月不用付我房租
Plus don't pay me for any rent this month.

143
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,860
-什么  -房租快到期了
- What? - Rent is due soon.

144
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,950
不过这个月不要付房租
Don't pay it this month.

145
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,980
还有下次你还想要卖血的话
And the next time you're thinking about selling your blood,

146
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,850
过来跟我说
come talk to me about it.

147
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,700
我并不喜欢这行为
I don't like it.

148
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,080
我不喜欢靠卖血为生的人
I don't like people selling their blood to eat.

149
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,470
虽说医院的病人需要别人献血
It's true the hospital medical people need people to donate blood,

150
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,940
但你已经献得够多了
but you've given enough already.

151
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,420
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

152
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,100
保存好你的血  克里斯克尔
Keep your blood, Kriscol.

153
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,060
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

154
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,320
你好  萨拉
Hello, Sarah.

155
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,080
霍克
Hawk.

156
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,340
一直想来找你
Been meaning to stop by.

157
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,420
有些旧案子的问题  我想到了你
Some old cases popped up, and I thought about you.

158
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,100
那你真好
That's very kind of you,

159
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,600
不过我猜你来
but I suppose you're really here

160
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,620
是为了杂货店发生的事吧
because of what happened in the grocery store.

161
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,810
是的  我听说了
Yeah, I heard about that.

162
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,320
他们都很担心你
Uh, people were worried about you.

163
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,800
我也不知道自己怎么了
I just don't know what came over me.

164
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,180
不过你现在没事了
But, uh, you're okay now.

165
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,840
我挺好的
I feel fine now.

166
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,270
-屋子里还有谁吗  -没有
- Is somebody in the house? - No.

167
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,880
没有  只是厨房里有些东西而已
No, just something in the kitchen.

168
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,130
你没事吧
You're okay, then.

169
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,880
这是个很糟糕的故事  对吧  霍克
It's a goddamn bad story, isn't it, Hawk?

170
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,710
萨拉  如果你需要帮忙
Sarah, if you need any help,

171
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,550
有任何需要
if you need anything,

172
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,410
给我打电话  好吗
I want you to call, okay?

173
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,000
我是说真的
I mean it.

174
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,630
任何帮助
Help of any kind.

175
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,530
谢谢你  霍克
Thanks, Hawk.

176
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,930
未知号码
拉斯维加斯吗

177
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,470
他们还没有说

178
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,970
-打搅一下  -什么事
- Excuse me. - Hmm?

179
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,820
杜鲁门警长来了
Sheriff Truman is here.

180
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,900
好  请他进来
Yeah, please, have him come in.

181
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,510
弗兰克
Frank.

182
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,820
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

183
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,180
最近还好吗
How are you?

184
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,830
请坐
Have a seat.

185
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,090
好
Yeah.

186
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,400
这个...
So...

187
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,360
有什么我可以帮你的吗
What can I do for you?

188
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,130
有点难以启齿  本
There's no easy way to say this, Ben.

189
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,740
是你的孙子理查德
Your grandson Richard

190
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,390
撞死了那个小男孩并逃逸了
was the one who ran over and killed that little boy.

191
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,340
天呐
Oh, my God.

192
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,780
理查德
Richard.

193
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,200
他好像还试图
And it looks like he tried

194
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,490
杀死本案的唯一目击者
to kill the only witness who saw him do it.

195
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,620
米里亚姆·沙利文
Miriam Sullivan.

196
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,430
一名幼教
Nursery school teacher.

197
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,550
她现在还在重症监护中
She's in intensive care.

198
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,110
没有保险
No insurance.

199
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,230
她现在急需手术
Desperately needs an operation.

200
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,590
我希望你能...
I was hoping that you could--

201
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,790
当然  当然
Of course. Of course.

202
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,340
费用由我来出
I'll take care of it.

203
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,310
理查德
Richard.

204
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,520
那个孩子就没做过什么好事
That boy has never been right.

205
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,910
很抱歉把这个坏消息告诉你
Sorry to have to bring you this news.

206
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,990
哈里  你弟弟
Harry, your brother,

207
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,080
已经抓过理查德好几次了
has had a number of run-ins with Richard.

208
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,060
也不是什么重罪
Nothing too bad,

209
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,960
只是每次都比上次要严重  还有....
but each time was worse than the time before, and...

210
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,590
哈里知道这件事吗
Does Harry know about this?

211
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,870
知道了
Yeah.

212
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,620
我们一直有联系
We stay in touch.

213
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,020
那理查德他...  他在哪  进监狱了吗
And Richard is-- Where is he? Is he in jail?

214
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,770
他还在逃逸中
He's on the run.

215
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,050
如果你有他的消息...
If you hear from him--

216
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,070
我不这么认为
Oh. I doubt that.

217
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,500
自从我拒绝再给他钱后
We pretty much lost contact

218
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,830
我们就基本上没联系了
when I refused to give him more money.

219
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,710
哈里怎么样了
How's Harry?

220
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,560
还撑得住
He's hanging in there.

221
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,680
当然  我们还是保持乐观
Course, we're hoping for the best.

222
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,270
当然
Of course.

223
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,630
那个女孩呢
And that girl?

224
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,930
她在这里的医院吗
Is she in the hospital here?

225
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,380
是的
Yeah.

226
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,180
在重症监护病房里
Intensive care?

227
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,580
是的
Yeah.

228
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,740
那那个小男孩的父母呢
And the boy's parents?

229
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,480
可想而知吧
As you can imagine.

230
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,510
我准备把这个寄给哈里
I was going to send this to Harry.

231
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,830
什么
What's that?

232
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,840
这把钥匙
The key here.

233
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,920
前几天随着邮件寄给我的
Showed up in the mail the other day.

234
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,470
我们近二十年来都没用过这种钥匙了
We haven't used a key like this in over 20 years.

235
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,500
315房
Room 315.

236
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,380
我很肯定这就是库柏特工
I'm pretty sure that this is the key

237
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,740
原来住的房间的钥匙
to Agent Cooper's old room.

238
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,620
我觉得哈里会想留个纪念
I thought Harry would like to have it as a memento.

239
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,650
你觉得他会吗
You think he would?

240
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,590
会
Yeah.

241
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,550
会的  本
Yeah, Ben.

242
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,380
你想我把这个带给他吗
You want me to take it for him?

243
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,660
好
Yeah.

244
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,650
好
Yeah.

245
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,470
你觉得他会喜欢吗
You think he would like it?

246
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,220
会的
Yeah.

247
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,540
很有意思
Interesting.

248
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,970
我们正好有个新案子和库柏特工有关
We're just opening up an old case involving Agent Cooper.

249
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,920
奇怪...
Strange...

250
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,510
过了这么多年这把钥匙突然冒了出来
this key shows up after all these years.

251
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,040
是啊
Yeah.

252
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,610
我也这么觉得
I thought so too.

253
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,290
我真的觉得他会喜欢的
I really think he would like it.

254
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,180
这会对他很有意义
It'd mean a lot to him.

255
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,380
抱歉  本  给你带来了这样一个坏消息
I'm sorry, Ben, to bring you this news.

256
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,630
很高兴再见到你
Good to see you again.

257
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,280
真希望不是因为这种事来找你
Wish it was under better circumstances.

258
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,190
没事
Yeah.

259
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,790
如果有他的消息  我会告诉你的
I'll let you know if, uh... if I hear from him.

260
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,040
我们有了新进展也会通知你的
I'll let you know if we have more news.

261
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,120
谢谢你  弗兰克
Thanks, Frank.

262
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,870
给哈里
For Harry.

263
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,420
理查德
Richard,

264
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,210
我的孙子
my grandson,

265
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,070
杀死了那个小男孩

266
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,440
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

267
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,440
理查德生下来就没有父亲
Richard never had a father.

268
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,180
我记得...
I remember...

269
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,380
我记得怎么骑自行车
I remember riding.

270
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,830
我父亲给了我一辆旧施文自行车...

271
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,910
二手的

272
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,470
他把它漆成了绿色
He painted it green,

273
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,170
安了一个新坐板
got a new seat for it.

274
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,670
两种绿色  有点儿...

275
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,100
柠檬绿和深丛林绿混在一起
kind of a lime green and a deep forest green.

276
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,500
轮胎很大
Fat tires.

277
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,650
好难骑
Oh, it was so hard to ride,

278
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,740
但我很喜欢那辆自行车

280
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,120
我和我的朋友一起骑自行车

281
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
打给医院
Call the hospital.

282
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,860
把她的费用都结清了  米里亚姆...
I want you to arrange to pay for all of Miriam, uh...

283
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,590
我记不清她姓什么了
I don't even remember her last name,

284
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,330
但他们会知道是谁的

285
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,670
米里亚姆的所有医疗费用
All of Miriam's medical expenses.

286
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,660
理查德袭击了她
Richard assaulted her.

287
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,090
她需要做手术
She needs an operation.

288
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,480
贝弗莉  请马上去办

289
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,410

294
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,750
陷阱已经布好了
The trap was set.

295
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,720
他们等待着午夜过后
They waited till after midnight,

296
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,020
然后75名壮汉翻过这座山
and then, 75 strong, they came up over the mountain,

297
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,620
警笛哀嚎  拔枪布阵
sirens wailing, guns drawn--

298
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,370
艾伯特
Albert.

299
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,410
戈登
Gordon,

300
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,200
你能要你的朋友到楼下等候吗
would you please ask your friend to wait downstairs?

301
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,960
亲爱的  你能让我们单独待会儿吗
Sweetheart, would you excuse us for a moment?

302
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,960
我到酒吧打给你
I'll call you in the bar.

303
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,790
好的  亲爱的
Oui, mon chéri.

304
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,750
很别致
Très chic.

305
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,910
太好喝了
Très bon.

306
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,730
这是好酒
It's a good one.

307
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,610
到了酒吧打给你
Call you at the bar.

308
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,110
她来这拜访一位她母亲的朋友
She's here visiting a friend of her mother

309
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,870
她女儿失踪了
whose daughter has gone missing.

310
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,610
她拥有一座萝卜地
The mother owns a turnip farm.

311
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,730
我要她告诉那位母亲
I told her to tell the mother

312
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,810
她女儿最后会出现的
that her daughter will turn up eventually.

313
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,620
她也没听懂
She didn't get it either.

314
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,460
她是法国人  语言不通
Being French, it doesn't translate.

315
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,630
你明白了吗  艾伯特
Do you realize, Albert,

316
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,660
如今地球上有超过六千种语言
that there are more than 6,000 languages spoken on Earth today?

317
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,670
什么事  艾伯特
What is it, Albert?

318
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,720
戴安收到了这样的短信
Incoming to Diane:

319
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,790
"拉斯维加斯吗"
"Las Vegas?"

320
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:13,370
她回道"他们还没说"
Outgoing: "They haven't asked yet."

321
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,710
我们还有什么没有跟她说的
What do we know that we haven't asked her about?

322
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,070
会知道的
We'll figure it out.

323
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,010
但目前  我真的很想继续享用
But for now, I'd really like to get back to

324
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,810
这瓶上等的波尔多葡萄酒
this fine Bordeaux.

325
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,450
什么酒
What kind is it?

326
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,350
11点05分
1105.

327
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,460
艾伯特
Albert...

328
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,320
你有时候真令我担心
...sometimes I really worry about you.

329
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,630
你确定吗
You sure?

330
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,110
我确定
I'm sure.

331
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,860
没时间折磨他了  宝贝
We don't have time for torture, babe.

332
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,410
我饿了
I'm hungry.

333
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,530
刚刚路过一家温迪汉堡
Passed a Wendy's back there.

334
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,110
开枪打死他就对了
Just shoot him.

335
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,740
好  没问题
Okay, I'm there.

336
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,730
我可以打他的腿
I can shoot him in the legs.

337
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,900
咱们绑架他
We kidnap him.

338
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,620
这样你就能折磨他
Then you could torture him.

339
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,520
我说过  我饿了
Told you, I'm hungry.

340
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,340
我就确认一下
Just making sure.

341
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,730
他来了
He's here.

342
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,060
爸爸
Daddy!

343
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,650
爸爸
Daddy.

344
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,120
下一站  温迪汉堡
Next stop, Wendy's.

345
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,140
爸爸
Daddy! Daddy!

346
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,320
爸爸
Daddy!

347
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,120
爸爸
Daddy!

348
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,390
七点了
It's seven o'clock.

349
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,760
你知道自由在哪吗
Do you know where your freedom is?

350
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,370
A号广播电台为您带来现场直播
Coming to you live and electrified from studio A,

351
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,520
来自美国兴都库什山的
high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak,

352
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,350
屋脊
the roof-- ruff, ruff--

353
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,800
白尾峰峭壁之巅的声音
of the American Hindu Kush,

354
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,530
这里是安普博士
this is Dr. Amp

355
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,770
唱响独立的颂歌
doing the vamp for liberty,

356
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,660
爬上正义的巅峰
climbing the ramp to justice,

357
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,170
点亮自由的灯火
and lighting the lamp of freedom.

358
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,630
那么
So...

359
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,580
你们今天晚上都在想些什么呢
what's on your mind tonight?

360
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,780
你知道我会讲我在想什么
I mean, you know I'm gonna tell you what's on mine.

361
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,660
我们正在陷入深深的泥潭
We're sinking down deep in the mud.

362
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,930
立刻行动起来
Act now!

363
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,820
朋友们
Friends,

364
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,960
我们都生活在泥潭里
we all live in the mud.

365
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,010
在一摊屎里
In the shit!

366
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,790
快把自己从屎里铲出来
Shovel your way out of the shit.

367
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,330
用这把亮闪闪的金铲子

双层漆  质量保证

帮你从屎里脱身

370
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,350
来迎接真理
and into the truth.

371
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,410
对我很有帮助  安普博士
It's working for me, Dr. Amp.

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,500
欲购从速
Get yours now.

378
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,600
那帮混蛋又来了
And the fucks are at it again!

379
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,010
那些巨大的跨国企业
These giant multinational corporations

380
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,210
全都是邪恶的害虫
are filled with monstrous vermin,

381
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,760
恶毒卑鄙的杀人凶手
poisonous, vile murderers,

382
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,950
他们吃喝拉撒的都是钱
and they eat, drink, and shit money.

383
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,160
他们廉价收买政客
They buy our politicians for a song.

384
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,490
政客夜夜笙歌  百姓水生火热
Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough,

385
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,520
被政府出卖  只能等死
sold down the river to die.

386
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,860
去你那些被选举出来帮助人民
Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help,

387
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,530
改善人民生活
elected to work to help

388
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,530
却背叛了人民的政客
to make life better for.

389
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,410
我操死你们  卖国的傀儡
Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets!

390
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,050
十八层炼狱会迎接你们
The ninth level of hell will welcome you.

391
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,710
够了  我不想再痴等着电话响
Okay, I'm tired of waiting for the phone to ring.

392
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,970
我要去酒馆
I'm going to the Roadhouse.

393
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,750
我知道他讨厌那个地方
I know he couldn't stand that place,

394
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,680
但其他地方我们已经找遍
but we've checked everywhere else.

395
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,700
你要和我一起去吗
Are you coming with me?

396
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,630
奥黛丽  瞧瞧我这些文件
Audrey, look at this paperwork I have,

397
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,550
我急着要处理
and I've got a deadline.

398
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,260
你瞧  堆积如山
Look, stacks of it.

399
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,750
我怎么能放下工作  深夜出门
How can I leave this and go out so late at night?

400
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,790
我也和你一样想找到比利  但...
I want to find Billy same as you, but...

401
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,470
不能明天一早再开始吗
can't we start out in the light of day?

402
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,180
今晚新月  外面漆黑一片
It's a new moon tonight. It'll be dark out there.

403
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,690
留下来  睡个好觉
Stay here and get a good sleep,

404
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,190
明天我们一起去找
and we'll both go looking tomorrow.

405
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,050
怎么有你这种混账
What kind of shit are you?

406
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,290
如果你失踪了
If you were missing,

407
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,570
你希望别人先做完他们该死的作业
would you want people finishing their fucking homework

408
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,660
再去找你吗
before they went looking for you?

409
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,320
你就是一个没种的窝囊废
You're nothing but a spineless, no-balls loser.

410
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,220
你自己知道吗
Do you know that?

411
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,470
知道吗  因为你真的就是这种人
Do you? Because that's what you really are.

412
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,400
奥黛丽
Audrey,

413
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,620
我有截止日期
I have a deadline.

414
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,580
我不得不做
I have to do this.

415
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,990
为什么要因为我尽自己的本分而批评我
Why do you put me down for doing my allotted duty in life?

416
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,370
比利在外头某处
Billy is out there somewhere,

417
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,450
但你今晚也找不着他的
but you're not gonna find him tonight.

418
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,820
我敢保证
I guarantee it.

419
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,160
你很肯定哦
Oh, you know for certain.

420
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,620
你是读了哪一颗水晶球的预言呢
What fucking crystal ball are you looking into?

421
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,160
怎么不向你的水晶球问卜
Why don't you ask your crystal ball

422
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,750
失踪两天的比利
where the fuck Billy is,

423
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,250
到底在哪里
who's been missing for two days?

424
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,130
问你的球啊
Ask your ball.

425
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,780
别这样  奥黛丽
Come on, Audrey.

426
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,330
你知道我没有水晶球
You know I don't have a crystal ball.

427
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,680
已经很晚了  我也困了
It's already late, and I'm getting sleepy.

428
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,360
我睡前还有好多工作要做
I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.

429
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,450
该死的可怜虫
You poor fucking thing.

430
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,840
我说过  别用这口气跟你老公说话
I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.

431
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,080
我一直对你很好
I've been good to you.

432
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,800
你总是说
You always say it,

433
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,300
我对你有多好
how I've been good to you.

434
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,410
那又怎样
Who cares?

435
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,180
怎么
What?

436
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,830
你要我无时无刻感激你
I got to thank you every hour on the hour,

437
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,720
每天跪拜你吗
get on my knees and adore you?

438
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,390
奥黛丽  我不喜欢你这种语调
Audrey, I don't like the tone of your voice.

439
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,870
查理
Look, Charlie,

440
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,290
咱们直话直说吧
let's just call a spade a spade.

441
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,640
你没种
You have no balls.

442
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,060
所以我才爱上比利
That's why I'm in love with Billy.

443
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,500
所以我才操比利
That's why I am fucking Billy.

444
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,510
奥黛丽
Audrey.

445
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,130
我昨晚梦见比利了
I saw Billy in my dream last night,

446
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,240
他的鼻孔和嘴巴都在流血
and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth.

447
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,200
有时候梦境会反映现实
And dreams sometimes hearken a truth.

448
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,070
我得走了  查理
Now, I got to go, Charlie.

449
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,860
我寻求你的陪伴
I asked for your company,

450
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,540
你的保护
your protection,

451
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,810
但你这胆小鬼
but you're such a milquetoast,

452
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,990
要保护也是我保护你
the only protection would be me protecting you.

453
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,140
还有蒂娜
And Tina--

454
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,160
我得去找蒂娜
I got to find Tina.

455
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,790
她是最后一个见到比利的人
She was the last person to see Billy,

456
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:08,580
而我受不了和她在同一屋檐下
and I can't fucking stand being in the same room with her.

457
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,540
你该打给她的  你从来不打
You were supposed to call her, but you never did.

458
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,940
别冲我发脾气了  奥黛丽
Don't be sore at me, Audrey.

459
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,660
你知道我只是为你好
You know I just want the best for you.

460
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,190
是吗
Yeah?

461
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,220
那就在我给你的文件上签字
Well, then sign the papers I gave you.

462
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,700
这我不确定  奥黛丽
Uh, I don't know, Audrey.

463
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,460
那些文件
Those papers...

464
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,210
似乎有点不靠谱
there's something fishy about them.

465
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,630
没经过我的律师审阅我不会签字
I'm not signing anything until I run them by my lawyer.

466
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,490
我懂了
Oh, I see.

467
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,530
那或许我该让保罗帮我看一看
Maybe I should run them by Paul.

468
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,960
或许我该请保罗来探望你
Maybe I should have Paul come give you a visit.

469
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,420
不  奥黛丽
Don't, Audrey.

470
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,550
别这样
Don't be like this.

471
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,520
我是你合法的丈夫
I'm your lawfully wedded husband.

472
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,310
我有权利
I have rights.

473
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,580
你放弃这些权利了
You gave up those rights.

474
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,370
什么
What?

475
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,810
你意思是要反悔我们的合约吗
You mean you'd go back on our contract?

476
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,580
你要违约吗
Renege on a contract?

477
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,500
我会这么做的
That's what I will do.

478
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,970
我正打算这么做
That's what I'm doing.

479
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,120
好吧  奥黛丽
Okay, Audrey.

480
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,110
我和你一起去
I'll go with you.

481
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,530
我好困  但我会陪你去
I'm so sleepy, but I'll go.

482
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,360
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

483
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,980
我们要去酒馆
We're going to the Roadhouse.

484
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,670
我跟你说了
I told you.

485
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,120
奥黛丽
Oh, Audrey.

486
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,220
那我去
I'll go, then.

487
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,760
我需要我的外套
I'll need my jacket.

488
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,080
我看你已经穿上你的了
I see you've already got yours.

489
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,130
当然了  不然你以为呢
Uh, yeah, what the fuck do you think?

490
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,800
我跟你说了我们要出去
I told you we were going out.

491
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,250
我显然需要我的外套
Obviously I'll need my jacket.

492
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,480
去外面要穿过一大片的林子
There's thousands of square miles of woods out there, Audrey.

493
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,940
我们就这么走出去
Do you think we're just gonna walk out the door

494
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,930
或者就这么冲到酒馆里
or waltz into the Roadhouse and presto,

495
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,410
他肯定就在吗
there he'll be?

496
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,640
赶紧去拿你的外套
Just get your jacket.

497
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,990
混蛋
Asshole.

498
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,670
等等
Wait a minute.

499
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,850
蒂娜
Tina.

500
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,720
让我给她打个电话  好吗
Let me call her now, okay?

501
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,590
我会告诉她我是一个人  但是...
I know, I'll tell her I'm alone, but...

502
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,160
我们看看她是不是知道些什么
let's see if she knows anything.

503
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,450
如果她丈夫在那里  她就说不了什么  但...
If her husband's there, she won't be able to talk, but...

504
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,290
我们试试
let's see.

505
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,830
好吗
Okay?

506
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,380
好啊  打给这贱人  看看她知道些什么
Okay, call the bitch. See what she knows.

507
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,620
假设她是最后一个见到比利的人
Supposedly she was the last one to see Billy,

508
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,600
但我觉得查克疯疯癫癫的
but I think Chuck is certifiable,

509
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,190
所以他的话我们不能全信
so we can't count on shit from him.

510
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,540
查克告诉你蒂娜是最后一个见到比利的人
Chuck told you Tina was the last person to see Billy?

511
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,280
是的
Yeah.

512
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,610
你知道查克上周偷走了比利的车吗
Did you know that Chuck stole Billy's truck last week?

513
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,920
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

514
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,010
比利从家里出来
Billy came out of his house

515
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,740
看到查克开着他的车走了
and saw Chuck driving off with his truck.

516
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,410
然后呢
And?

517
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,140
然后比利找了警长
And Billy called the sheriff.

518
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,610
然后呢
And?

519
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,990
那天下午他们就找到了那辆车
And they found the truck that same afternoon.

520
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,860
那然后呢
So what happened, then?

521
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,130
他们就联系了比利
They called Billy,

522
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:37,640
我猜比利找回了车  没有提出控诉
and I guess Billy got his truck back and dropped any charges.

523
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,520
真的吗
Really?

524
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,370
好吧
Okay.

525
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,750
打给蒂娜
Call Tina.

526
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,350
我太累了  奥黛丽
I'm so tired, Audrey.

527
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,620
喂
Hello?

528
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,520
蒂娜  我是查理
Yes, Tina. It's Charlie.

529
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,140
你好吗
How are you?

530
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,970
是吗
Yeah?

531
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,130
我知道
Yeah, I know.

532
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,270
不好意思这么晚才打给你
Sorry to call so late.

533
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,960
我想问你点事情
I wanted to ask you something.

534
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,750
好吗
Okay?

535
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,540
查克告诉我
Yeah, so Chuck told me

536
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,850
你可能是最后一个见到比利的人
you might have been the last person to see Billy.

537
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,080
是真的吗
Is this true?

538
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,270
什么
What?

539
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,580
我知道
Yeah, I know that.

540
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,790
你确定吗
You're sure?

541
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,680
但是...
But...

542
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,390
好吧
Okay.

543
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,870
好
Yeah.

544
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,530
是的  蒂娜
Yes, Tina.

545
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,460
好的
Okay.

546
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,220
你怎么知道...什么
How did you find-- What?

547
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,650
真的吗
Really?

548
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,030
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness.

549
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,310
谢谢你  蒂娜
Thank you, Tina.

550
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,240
好
Great.

551
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,380
我们回头再说
I'll talk to you soon.

552
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,230
我明天联系你
I'll try tomorrow.

553
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,200
嗯  还是要为这么晚才联系你道歉
Yeah, again, sorry to call so late.

554
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,760
你跟我说的这些简直难以置信
Unbelievable, what you're telling me.

555
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,780
我不会的
I won't.

556
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,230
快...
Come...

557
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,880
我保证
I promise.

558
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,060
我也是
Yeah, me too.

559
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,580
再见
Bye.

560
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,710
你不会告诉我她说了什么
You're not gonna tell me what she said?

561
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,060
你不会告诉我她说了什么
You're not gonna tell me what she said?

562
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,150
查理
Charlie!

563
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,280
我知道你们关门了
I know you're closed.

564
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,250
谢谢
Thanks.

565
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,900
坐标
Coordinates.

566
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,420
坐

569
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,460
双峰镇

570
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:05,040
双峰镇

571
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:49,950
枪炮酒吧

572
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,820
安琪拉在哪里
Where's Angela?

573
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,940
我不知道
I haven't got a clue.

574
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,130
她昨晚说好要来的
She was supposed to show last night.

575
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,810
但她也没有出现
She didn't show then either.

576
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,690
她可能在和克拉克一起
She might be with Clark.

577
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,980
克拉克
Clark?

578
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,230
是啊
Yeah.

579
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,420
他们最近总是在一起
They've been hanging out lately.

580
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,620
真的吗
Really?

581
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,120
是啊
Yeah.

582
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,170
你看起来很惊讶
You look surprised.

583
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,440
是啊  因为我大概两个晚上前还看到
Yeah, 'cause I saw Clark and Mary together here,

584
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,930
克拉克和玛丽一起在这里
like, two nights ago.

585
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,450
我很她
I hate her.

586
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,860
安琪拉也恨她
And Angela fucking really hates her too.

587
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,010
他们在这里干什么
What were they doing?

588
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,440
就是在亲热
Like, practically making out.

589
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,760
慢摇  靠得非常近
Slow dancing and getting real close.

590
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:19,580
就在那个角落
Over in the corner.

591
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,840
沉浸在他们的世界里
Off in their own world.

592
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,360
很多人都看到他们了
Lots of people saw 'em.

593
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,320
要是安琪拉知道了  肯定会气疯了
Angela's gonna go crazy when she gets wind of this.

594
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,580
她对克拉克很认真
She's getting really serious about Clark.

595
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,740
她喜欢他好几周了
He's been on her for a couple of weeks now.

596
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,210
她甚至还会梦到他
She's even dreaming about the guy.

597
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,480
操
Shit.

598
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,230
看来克拉克就是在广撒网
I guess Clark's spreading it around.

599
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,400
她现在还停药了
And she's off her meds now.

600
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,680
我希望克拉克别惹出什么乱子
I hope Clark doesn't fuck this up.

601
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,230
我觉得她肯定接受不了
She won't be able to take it, I don't think.

602
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,730
是啊
Well, yeah.

603
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,160
她情绪很不稳定
She's kind of on the edge.

604
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,790
谁不会呢
Who wouldn't be?

605
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,790
她妈妈那样死的
Losing her mom like that?

606
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,610
操
Fuck.

607
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,260
我来这里的路上差点被杀了
I almost got fucking killed coming over here.

608
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,820
某个混蛋在路上朝我冲过来
Some fucking ass-eater's heading toward me on the highway

609
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,820
把我别出了主路
and runs me off the road.

610
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,550
我就看到两盏大灯冲着我
All I see is two headlights coming fucking right at me.

611
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,660
我驶离了道路  差点撞上一棵树
I drove off the road and almost hit a tree.

612
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,780
还是一个农民把我从车里拉出来的
Some farmer had to pull me out.

613
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,470
该死  真想把那个肇事的家伙杀了
Man, I could kill the motherfucker that did that.

614
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,730
我需要瓶啤酒  你们肯定也要加
I need a beer. Obviously you want one too.

615
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,260
-要加一瓶吗  -好的
- Do you want another one? - Yeah, sure.

616
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,750
好的  我马上回来
All right, I'll be right back.

617
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,410
谢了  特里克
Thanks, Trick.

618
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,230
感觉特里克能捡回一条命真是走运
Trick's lucky to be alive, sounds like.

619
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,930
是啊
Sure does.

620
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,620
特里克不是被软禁了吗
By the way, isn't Trick under house arrest?

621
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:44,220
没有啊  我是说  这件事已经过去
No. I-I mean, yeah, but he got that behind him now.

622
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,740
他又自由了
He's a free man again.

623
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,110
自由人
A free man.

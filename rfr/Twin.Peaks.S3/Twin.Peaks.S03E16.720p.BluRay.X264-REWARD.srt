集中精力
Pay attention.

一会就知道了
You'll find out.

24

我在找一个地方
I'm looking for a place.

25
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,810
你明白什么叫地方吗
Do you understand the place?

26
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,310
地方
Place?

27
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,790
有三个人分别给了我那地方的坐标
Three people have given me coordinates to that place.

28
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,130
其中两份是吻合的
Two of the coordinates match.

29
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,690
你会怎么做  理查德
What would you do, Richard?

30

我会去查那处两份吻合的
I'd check out the two that match.

31
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
你真是个聪明的年轻人
You're a very bright young man.

32
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,400
我们就快到达吻合的那个地方了
And we're very close to the two that match.

33
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,260
这显示就在那上面
It says it's right up there.

34
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,770
我们要上去吗
We're going up there?

35
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,900
是的
Yeah.

36
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,280

是人
People?

39
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
就是这里吗
Is this it?

40
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,790
我打赌就在那岩石上
I'll bet it's right up there on that rock.

41
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,350
我比你老25岁
I'm 25 years your senior.

42
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,870
拿着这个  上去
Take this and get on up there.

43
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,670
如果接近了就会发出嘀嘀声
It'll beep when you're close

44
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,560
如果到了地方就会持续作响
And make a continuous tone when you're on it.

45
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,140
告诉我你发现了什么
Let me know what you find.

46
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,460
我到了
I'm there!

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,690
永别了  我的孩子
Good-bye, my son.

48
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,950
破望远镜
Bad, bad binoculars.

49
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,910
破望远镜
Bad binoculars!

50

破破破  真是破望远镜
Bad, bad, bad binoculars!

51
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,830
全部

52

你今早听到那鸟叫了吗
You hear that bird this morning?

54
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,230
当然
Sure as shit did.

55
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,020
谁来了
Who's this here?

56
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,640
他们来干什么
What the hell are they doing here?

57
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,330
看起来没人在
Well, it looks like nobody's home.

58
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,830
你怎么推断出来的呢  神探夏洛克
And how did you deduce that, sherlock?

59
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,820
威尔森  混蛋  去找辆车停在什么地方
Wilson, you son of a bitch, go grab a car and park somewhere

60
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,540
别让人看到  盯着这房子
Over there out of sight and stake out this house.

61
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,660
好吧

赶紧滚蛋
Good riddance.

68
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,500
医生说的跟你说的一样
I just heard what you've been telling me.

69
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,940
他处于昏迷中
He's in a coma,

70
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
但主要体征都很正常  也很强健
But his vital signs are good, strong.

71
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,230
是啊  但人们陷入昏迷的话
Yeah, but when people go into a coma,

72
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,280
可以持续很多年
they can stay there for years.

73
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,010
道吉不会的
Oh, Dougie's not gonna do that.

74
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,400
妈妈  昏迷跟电有关吗
Mom, does a coma have something to do with electricity?

75
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,270
没有  亲爱的
No, honey.

76
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,960
他这情况是有关的
Well, in this case, it did.

这种事时有发生
Uh, this sort of thing happens,

90
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,590
你不想做饭

91

也不想吃医院的食物

吃吧
Go ahead.

96

用手指把它拈起来
You pick it up with your fingers.

97
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,860
非常好  所以才叫手指三明治

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,460
无人敲门
No knock...

294
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,920
门铃未响
No doorbell...

295
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,880
他就这么走了进来
...He just walked in.

296
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,740
我站在我的客厅
I was standing in my living room.

297
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,030
当时见到他我好开心
Oh, I was so happy to see him.

298
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,530
我紧紧拥抱他
I held him so close.

299
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,080
接着我们
And we, uh...

300
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,840
我们坐在沙发
We sat on my sofa.

301
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,430
开始聊天
Started talking.

302
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,630
我好想听他说说
I just wanted to hear everything

303
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,090
他去了哪些地方
about where he'd been and...

304
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,890
做了些什么
...what he'd been doing.

305
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,510
而他只想知道
He only wanted to know about, uh...

306
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,680
当时联调局的情况
what had been going on at the bureau.

307
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,460
我觉得他好像在拷问我
It felt like he was grilling me.

308
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,580
但我...
But I...

309
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,350
我告诉自己他只是
I told myself he was just...

310
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,050
他只是很想听听局里的新闻
He was just excited to hear about bureau news.

311
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,420
然后他靠过来
And then he leaned in.

312
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,780
他靠过来
He leaned in...

313
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
靠过来亲了我
Leaned in to kiss me.

314
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,210
我们只亲过一次
It only happened once before.

315
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,070
但是当...
But as soon as...

316
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,250
当他的嘴唇触碰到我的嘴唇
as soon as his lips touched mine...

317
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,200
感觉有点不对劲
...something went wrong.

318
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,850
我觉得很害怕
And I felt afraid.

319
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,660
他看到了我眼中的恐惧
And he saw the fear in me.

320
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,370
然后他笑了
And he smiled.

321
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,710
他笑了
He smiled.

322
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,310
然后他的脸
A-and his face...

323
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,070
然后就这么发生了
and that's when it started.

324
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,830
他强奸了我
He raped me.

325
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,690
他强奸了我
He raped me.

326
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,080
后来
Afterward,

327
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,340
他带我去了一个地方
he took me somewhere.

328
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,690
他带我去了一个地方...
He took me somewhere like a...

329
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,730
好像是一个旧加油站
an old gas station.

330
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,110
旧...
Uh, old...

331
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,160
一个旧加油站
An old gas station.

332
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,050
未知号码
[笑脸]全部

333
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,090
我在警长办公室
I'm in the sheriff's station.

334
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,740
我在警长办公室
I'm in the sheriff's station.

335
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,140
我把那些坐标都发给他了
I-I sent him those coordinates.

336
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,560
我在警长办公室
I'm in the sheriff's station...

337
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,830
因为...因为...
Because--because...

338
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,970
我不是我了
I'm not me.

339
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,160
我不是...
I-I'm not...

340
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,890
我不是我了
I'm not me.

341
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,330
我...我不是

342
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,250
我不是我了
I'm not me.

343
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,430
它们是真的
They're real.

344
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,720
这真的是幻人
That was a real tulpa.

345
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,420
警长办公室
Sheriff's station?

346
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,290
有人

347
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,650
造出一个你

348
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,590
我知道
I know.

349
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,070

你看上去好极了  你看上去太好了

354
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,900
我们要去哪里

355
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,970
伙计们  给我几分钟

道吉说话有底气多了
You know, Dougie's talking with a lot of assurance.

358
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,750
也许和昏迷有什么关系
Maybe something to do with the coma?

359
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,340
副作用
Side effects.

360
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,500
我要离开一阵子

你是我爸爸

我是你爸爸  桑尼·吉姆

我要走了

我会走进那扇红色的门

381
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,610
永远地回家

382
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,800
别走
Don't go.

383
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,880
我必须要走
I have to.

384
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,670
不管你是谁
Whoever you are...

00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,300
谢谢你
Thank you.

386
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,560
道吉  让我来理一理

387
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,450
等等  等等  我也想听

好了
Okay.

390
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,890
你不卖保险
You don't sell insurance.

391

你是个联调局探员
You're an FBI agent...

392

失踪了25年
who's been missing for 25 years,

393
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,440
我们要带你取一个叫双峰镇的地方
and we need to get you to a town called Twin Peaks,

394
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,350
去警长办公室

395
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,180
道吉
Dougie...

我们爱你
We love you,

397
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,460
但是那种地方一般不欢迎我们

398
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,750

00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,750
我很清楚
I am witness to the fact

404
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,450
你们俩都有一颗赤子之心

They do.

406
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,660
他们真的有

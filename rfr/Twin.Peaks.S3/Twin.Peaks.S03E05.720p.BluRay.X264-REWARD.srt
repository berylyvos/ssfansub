我们刚经过  他的车还停在那里
We just drove by. His car's still there.

17
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,210
搞什么  基恩
What the hell, Gene?

18
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,490
时间轴     没有影子   啾啾啾

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,530
他还在里面吗
Is he still inside?

20
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,870
不知道  但是里面的灯亮着
Can't tell, but the lights are on in there.

21
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,490
后期     8T

22
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,820
操  基恩  本来昨天就应该完事了
Fuck, Gene! This job was supposed to be done yesterday.

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,490
你是想害死我吗
Are you trying to get me killed?

24
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,490
总监     小酸奶

25
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,840
你想让我们怎么办
What do you want us to do?

26
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,190
我们听你的
We're all over it.

27
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,460
操
Fuck!

28
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,080
她真爱操心
She's a worrier.

29
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,350
是啊
Yeah.

30
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,890
探员
2

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,090
死因
Cause of death...

32
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,920
我花了不少时间  但我觉得是有人把他的头砍了
Took me a while, but I think someone cut this man's head off.

33
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,090
头条来了
Here's the headline.

34
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,970
其实我已经给你们看过"头条"了
Actually, I just gave you the headline.

35
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,190
没错  我周末还是会去讲单口相声
Yeah, I'm still doing stand-up on the weekends.

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
这个人好几天没吃东西了
This man hadn't eaten for days,

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,230
至少没吃过什么食物
at least not any food,

38
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,160
但我在他肚子里找到了这个
but I found this in his stomach.

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,500
恕我愚见  我会从妻子入手
Maybe it's just me, but I'd start with the wife.

40
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,760
上面有刻字
It's inscribed.

41
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,450
是的  刻的是
Yes, it says...

42
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,910
"给道吉
"To Dougie,

43
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,280
爱你  珍妮·E"
with love, Janey-E."

44
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,740
现在  吃的来了
And now food is coming.

45
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,620
你还和我一起
You're still with me.

46
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,290
很好
That's good.

47
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,350
帮我叫史蒂文进来一下
Could you send in Steven, please?

48
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,520
先生  你想见我
Sir, you wanted to see me?

49
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,210
没错  我想见你  坐
Yes, I wanted to see you. Sit down.

50
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,490
好吧
Okay.

51
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,660
很好
Great.

52
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,280
不大好
Yeah, well, not great.

53
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,400
你觉得你自己很厉害吗
You think you're some sort of hotshot?

54
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,990
什么
Excuse me?

55
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,240
这是我见过写得最差的简历
This résumé is one of the worst written I've ever seen,

56
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,070
你的表格都没填对
and you didn't even fill out this form properly.

57
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,880
完全不对  没完成
Not even close. It's incomplete.

58
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,190
根本不是懒惰的程度
It's worse than sloppy.

59
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,070
我想见你是想告诉你
I wanted to see you to tell you

60
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,650
如果你想找到工作
that if you ever want to find work anyplace,

61
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,700
你最好表现好一点  做该做的事
then you better get your act together, do things properly,

62
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,140
作为一名未来的员工  表现出一点应有的尊重
and start showing some respect for a possible future employer,

63
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,310
因为就凭这张表  这里永远不会雇你
because based on this shit, you'd never get hired here,

64
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,370
我也绝对不会为你做任何推荐
and I would never recommend you for any work, anyplace.

65
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,630
现在你可以站起来离开这里了
Now, you can get up and get your ass out of here.

66
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,070
真是混蛋
What an asshole.

67
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,380
双峰镇
警局

68
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,900
那可难办了
That's rough.

69
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,410
是啊
Yeah.

70
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,470
你什么时候能拿到那些结果
When do you get those tests back?

71
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,850
杜鲁门警长
Sheriff Truman?

72
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,340
你妻子来了
Your wife is here.

73
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,700
她去你办公室了  你不在那里
She went to your office, and you weren't there.

74
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,390
我没告诉她
I could have told her that.

75
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,780
-等一下  -她现在正在
- Hold on a minute.  - She is now walking

76
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,460
去副警长霍克的办公室
to Deputy Chief Hawk's office,

77
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,120
你就在里面
where you are.

78
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,180
谢谢你  露西
Thank you, Lucy.

79
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,270
多丽丝来了
Doris is coming.

80
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,530
你坚持住  哈里
You hang tough, Harry.

81
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,320
好吧  我明天再来找你
Okay. I'll check in with you tomorrow.

82
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,880
你为什么不在你自己办公室
Why aren't you in your office?

83
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,240
因为我在这里
Because I'm here.

84
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,540
你在嘲笑我吗
You making fun of me?

85
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,600
什么事  多丽丝
What is it, Doris?

86
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,530
德怀特腹泻了
Dwight's got diarrhea.

87
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,630
双胞胎这周末要来
The twins are coming this weekend.

88
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,970
他又爬到最上面的碗橱了
He got in the upper cupboard again.

89
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,830
管道漏水都不能让我喘一口气
And I am not going another day with a leaking pipe.

90
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,580
厨房地板都被淹没了
It soaked the pantry floor,

91
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,160
我们要长黑霉菌了  弗兰克
and we're gonna get that black mold, Frank!

92
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,950
你打给他们了吗
Did you call them?

93
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,490
打了
Yes.

94
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,060
他们很忙
They're very busy.

95
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,480
他们知道管道漏水的事了
They know all about the leaking pipe

96
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,080
保证明晚之前就能修好
and promise to have it fixed by tomorrow night.

97
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,330
那也就是说我还得忍一整天
So I have to go a full day with a leaking pipe?

98
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,360
你知道这会导致什么后果吗
Do you realize what this is gonna cause?

99
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,910
你放了一个桶在下面吗
You have a bucket under it?

100
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,800
没错
Yes!

101
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,110
但桶会满
But it filled up,

102
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,390
然后水又会溢到地板上
and it slopped all over the floor.

103
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,700
我不可能盯着那水桶一天  弗兰克
I can't keep my eye on a bucket all day, Frank.

104
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,380
你能买个大点的桶吗
Can you get a bigger bucket?

105
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,400
所以我是要把钱花在一个
So I can spend money on a bucket

106
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,650
我们以后可能不会再用的水桶上
that we'll probably never use again,

107
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,650
却不能用这钱买
but I can't spend money

108
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,740
我那张超爱的地毯
on that new rug that I really like.

109
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,930
是这个意思吗
Is that it?

110
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,260
这不公平  弗兰克
That is not fair, Frank.

111
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,520
还有我爸爸的车呢
And what about Dad's car?

112
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,450
我是不会
I'm not gonna have him killed

113
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,720
让他被那破车害死的
in that damn death-trap car.

114
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,710
我跟你说过这事了
I told you this.

115
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,520
萨米去看过了
Sammy looked at it,

116
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,740
没什么问题
and it's fine.

117
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,730
什么时候
When?

118
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,920
大概两小时之前吧
About two hours ago.

119
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,340
你怎么不打电话告诉我
Well, I wish you would've called me.

120
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,670
我就可以在家里等着了
I've been just waiting at the house

121
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,130
以防爸爸要搭车去什么地方
in case Dad needed a ride somewhere.

122
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,620
你真是无可救药
You're impossible!

123
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,880
上车  桑尼·吉姆
Go get in the car, Sonny Jim.

124
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,860
听着  我把钱都藏好了
Okay, I hid the money.

125
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,040
我数过
I counted it--

126
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,310
一共有425,000美元
$425,000.

127
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,930
不用担心  它们在很隐秘的地方
Don't worry. It's in our secret place.

128
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,790
现在  你到公司后给他们打个电话  定个时间
Now, when you get to work, call them and set up a time

129
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,250
然后给他们5万美元  行吗
and pay them their 50 grand, okay?

130
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,970
从此我们就付清债务自由了
Then we'll be free and clear.

131
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,910
好了  道吉  你真他妈奇怪
Okay, Dougie, you're acting weird as shit.

132
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,680
别忘了打给他们  好吗
Just don't forget to call them, okay?

133
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,150
以后别再去喝酒赌博了
And no more drinking and gambling.

134
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,860
走吧  你上班快迟到了
Now get going. You'll be late for work.

135
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,240
上班
Work.

136
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,190
你的车
Damn. Your car.

137
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,180
行了  上车  我送你去公司
Okay, get in. I'll drive you.

138
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,880
话说  你的车去哪了
Where is your car, anyway?

139
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,510
上车
In the car!

140
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,050
兰彻·罗莎

141
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,880
内华达州

142
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,080
下车  道吉
Get out of the car, Dougie.

143
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,350
你应该是这几天状态不好
I think you're having one of your episodes.

144
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,870
听我说
Now listen to me.

145
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,760
你要打起精神来
You need to pull yourself together

146
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,880

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,080
米彻姆兄弟的礼物
Mitchum brothers.

62
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,530
你想把游乐设施放哪
Where do you want the gym?

63
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,810
后院吧

64
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,360
好的  伙计们
All right. Guys!

65
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,000
我们走  后院
Let's go. The backyard.

66
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,260

67

昨晚你没回家

68

我想到了最糟的可能性
I thought the worst.

69
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,260
看看你都干了什么

还有那车

西蒙大拿州

操
Fuck.

78
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,550
怎么了  雷
What's the problem, Ray?

79
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,750
我明明把那家伙杀了
I killed that guy.

80
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,210
他就是我跟你说的那人
He's the one I told you about.

81
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
看来你没杀得太彻底啊  雷
You didn't kill him too good, Ray.

82
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
这次一定彻底
I will now.

83
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,790
雷  你在这里吗
Hey, Ray, you in here somewhere?

84
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,870
他怎么弄到密码的
And how did he get the code?

85
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,320
我给他的
I gave it to him.

86
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,400
我来看看你  伙计
Came to see you, buddy.

87
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,730
但只给了门的密码
But only to the door.

88
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,480
所以他被困住了
So he's trapped.

89
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,820
他是我的了
And mine.

90
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,330
好吧
All right.

91
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,570
我会把他留给你
I'll let you have him.

92
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,860
但我想先跟他玩玩
I want to have some fun with him first.

93
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,420
把他带上来
Bring him up!

94
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,630
进电梯
Get in the elevator.

95
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,200
把枪放下  雷
Put the gun away, Ray.

96
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,820
这里什么情况
What do we have here?

97
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,530
我来看我的朋友雷
I came to see my friend Ray.

98
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,870
我在这里
I'm here,

99
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,100
你这混蛋
you fuck.

100
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,100
冷静点  雷
Settle down, Ray.

101
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,460
看来我们有个新的竞争者了
Looks like we got ourselves a new contestant here.

102
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,160
跟他说说规矩  穆迪
Tell him how it works, Muddy.

103
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,260
很简单
Real simple.

104
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,900
这位是我们的老大
This man is our boss...

105
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,430
因为没人能在扳手腕比赛中赢过他
'cause no one can beat him at arm wrestling.

106
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,510
想象一下  那么多尝试过的人
Imagine all the men who've tried.

107
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,560
太多太多了
Many, many.

108
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,200
14年了
In 14 years,

109
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,920
没人有过一丁点胜算
no one's ever even come close.

110
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,010
任何新来的人都能有一次机会
Any new guy gets one chance.

111
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,320
就一次
One chance.

112
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,810
如果输了
And if you lose,

113
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,070
伦佐就成为你的老大
Renzo's your boss.

114
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,100
你可以现在离开
So you can leave now.

115
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,820
如果你留下  然后输了
If you stay and lose

116
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,510
却不按伦佐说的做
and you do not do what Renzo says...

117
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,220
你就会死
you die.

118
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,480
你自己决定吧
So you decide.

119
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,550
是否留下比赛  决定权在你
You stay and play the game. It's your choice.

120
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,000
瞧瞧你那样
Looking at you,

121
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,800
我觉得你还是走吧
I'd say you better leave.

122
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,710
这里算什么
What is this,

123
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,850
托儿所吗
kindergarten?

124
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,860
幼儿园
Nursery school?

125
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,720
如果我赢了呢
What do I get if I win?

126
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,430
那你就成为我们的老大
Then you'd be our boss.

127
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,350
我可不想当你们的老大
I don't want to be your boss.

128
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,200
但我如果赢了  我要他
But if I win, I want him.

129
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,090
请进来
Step inside.

130
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,480
咱们比一场吧
Let's play the game.

131
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,910
这是幼儿园老师送你的

132
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,300

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,620

137
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,430
另一只手不能触碰桌子

140
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,560
我说开始才能开始
Do not start until I say.

141
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,940
你准备好了吗  老大

142
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,410
准备好了
Ready.

He's not ready.

181
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,400

他说你身上有他们想要的东西

杀了你之后把这东西放你身上

209
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,860
你从哪得来的

211
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,810
拿到这东西的

你真以为我会告诉你吗
Do you really think I'm gonna give them to you?

你真觉得我给你的数字可信吗
You really think you could even trust the numbers I give you?

我知道你谁

那要看看里面是什么
Depends on what's in the pocket.

226

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,770
有人盯上我们了  所以我需要那些东西
Somebody's onto us. That's why I need the stuff.

297
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,590
这你得花点钱了
It's gonna cost you.

五

300
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,190
就能搞定
It'll do the job,

301
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,960
给你两小时的时候离开
give you two hours to get away.

302
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,580
对你这种胆小鬼完全足够了
It's perfect for a chickenshit punk like you.

303
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,800
我会把钱弄来的
I'll get the money.

304
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840

他要按耐不住了
He's cracking.

308
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,620
那混蛋想要毒害某人
The fuck wants to poison somebody.

309
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,290
我打给托德先生
I'll call Mr. Todd.

310
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,950
好
Yeah.

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,070
他们甚至不会在婚前发生性行为
they don't even have sex before marriage.

318
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,120
但是在他们结婚的时候
Yeah, but when they do get married,

319
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,260
我听说他们
I heard they-- they can marry, like,

320
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,520
能娶六或十个女人

321
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,310
好笑的是他们的人只有这么点
Funny there's not more of them.

322
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,330
我猜是因为酒的原因
I guess it's the drinks.

323

344
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,090
这么难喝啊
That bad, huh?

345
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,910
道吉
Dougie!

346

也许他只是需要点时间

不  不如这样吧
No, you know what?

363
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,930
不如你过来这里
Why don't you come down here,

364
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,180
我给你来一块美味的樱桃派

Okay, hurry up, and we'll find some time to talk, okay?

371

好  谢谢  我爱你
Okay, thanks. I love you.

372
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,580
我也爱你
I love you, too.

373
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,300
我...
I--

374
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,630
不敢相信我犯了...
I can't believe what I've don--

375
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,770
不敢相信我成了这种人
I can't believe what I've become.

376
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,040
我企图给道吉下毒
I tried poisoning Dougie.

377
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,910
他一眼就识穿了  天呐
He saw right through me. Oh, God.

378
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,810
他是如此宽宏大量
He was so kind about it.

379
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,450
不敢相信我想干出这等苟且之事
I can't believe what I was about to do.

380
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,710
我一定要认错

布什内尔...

好几个月来
I've been selling you down the river

386
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,950
我一直都在为邓肯·托德出卖你
for months and months for Duncan Todd.

387
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,660
我一直在给托德做事
I've been working for Todd.

388
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,860
我...
I--

389
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,170
我撒了谎  骗了钱
I've lied and cheated for money.

390
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,330
安东尼...
Anthony...

391
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,000
道吉已经告诉我了
Dougie already showed me.

392
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,980
他已经把这些全都告诉我了
He explained all this already.

393
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,350
真的吗
He did?

394
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,480
既然你已经认错了
Now that you're confessing,

395
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,860
不得不说我对你的愤怒
I have to admit that my anger,

396
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,910
还有鄙视正在平息
my contempt for you is subsiding.

397
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,100
道吉甚至把自己搭进去了
Dougie even implicated himself.

398
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,940
他告诉我你是如何操控索赔单
And he showed me how you manipulated claims,

399
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,730
你让我失去了一大笔钱
and you cost me plenty.

400
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,720
我之前很信任你  安东尼
I trusted you, Anthony.

401
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,610
我视你为朋友
I looked at you as my friend

402
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,780
我的头牌销售顾问

403
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,980
头牌销售顾问
Number-one sales agent.

404
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,780
我怎么能这样忽悠你
How can I make it up to you?

405
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,210
我对自己所作所为感到无比羞愧
I'm so ashamed of what I've done.

406
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,310
要不是道吉
And if it weren't for Dougie,

407
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,060
我可能就成了一个杀人犯了
I might have a murder on my hands.

408
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,560
天啊  我该怎么办
Oh, my God, what can I do?

409
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,100
我准备把你送走很长很长一段时间
I was prepared to send you away for a long, long time.

410
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,790
但现在...
But now...

411
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,870
你愿意指证邓肯·托德吗
are you prepared to testify against Duncan Todd?

412
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,820
愿意
Y-yes.

413
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,430
愿意
Y-yes.

414
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,330
愿意  即使我会在这之间死掉
Yes, even if I die in the process.

415
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,400
我几星期没合眼
I haven't slept for weeks.

416
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,870
我还吐了血  我不能再这样生活下去了
I vomited blood. I can't live like this.

417
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,240
我只想死或者做出改变
I only want to die or change.

418
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,420
布什内尔  请帮帮我

419
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,980
我只想重回正道
I only want to make things right again.

420
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,940
还有那两个道吉发现的警察呢
And these two cops that Dougie found?

421
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,750
什么  他连他们俩也都知道了
Wha-- He knows about them, too?

422
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,240
他们俩  也
Them, too.

423
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,950
他们比托德还要坏
They're worse than Todd.

424
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,940
你不知道你在问什么
You don't know what you're asking.

425
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,730
我其实不是在问你  安东尼
I'm not really asking, Anthony.

426
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,350
我只想弥补我犯下的错
I-I only want to fix this mess I made.

427
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,980
道吉救了我的命
Dougie saved my life.

428
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,940

Hey, Norma.

441
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,490
雪莉已经回家了吗
Shelly go home already?

442
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,180
是的
Yeah, she did.

443
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,450
好吧
Oh, okay.

444
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,430
那就不打扰二位了
I'll leave you two.

445
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,960
不不  过来一起吃晚餐吧
No, no, come and have some dinner.

446
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,170
我刚点了  谢谢
I just ordered. Thanks.

447
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,010
博比  快给我坐过来
Bobby, get your butt back over here.

448
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,020
独自进餐可不好
It's no good eating alone.

449
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,220
谢谢
Thanks.

450
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,550
那...
So...

451
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,710
有什么新鲜事吗  副警长
What's new, Deputy?

452
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,690
我们今天找到了一些我爸留下的东西
Oh, well, we, uh, found some stuff that my dad left today.

453
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,530
-真的吗  -嗯
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

454
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,850
什么样的东西
What kind of stuff?

455
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,240
还不知道  但它...
Don't know yet, but it--

456
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,710
是个什么东西
something.

457
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,970
知道吗
You know?

458
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,280
谢谢
Thanks.

459
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,090
不过我们会查明的
We're gonna check it out, though.

460
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,580
我会告诉你结果的
I'll tell you that.

461
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,840
我去给你取餐  艾德
I'll go bring your dinner, Ed.

462
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,600
你希望我换个座位吗
Hey? You want me to move to another booth?

463
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,610
这样你们好...
So you guys can...?

464
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,330
没原因  伙计  这里不会发生什么
No reason, pal. Nothing happening here.

465
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,760
-给你  -谢谢你  宝贝
- There you go. - Thanks, babe.

466
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,420
你来了
Hey, you.

467
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,010
你好  亲爱的
Hey, girl.

468
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,000
你俩聊
You two talk business.

469
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,940
我们换个地方坐
We'll move somewhere else.

470
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,180
很高兴见到你  沃尔特
Good to see you, Walter.

471
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,830
我也很高兴见到你
Oh, yeah. Good to see you, too.

472
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,880
他叫什么来着
What's his name again?

473
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,580
艾德
Ed.

474
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,640
艾德·赫尔利
Ed Hurley.

475
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,450
对  是
Oh, right, yeah.

476
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,850
你看起来很美
You're looking beautiful.

477
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,600
谢谢
Well, thanks.

478
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,550
我该怎么感谢你呢
So, uh, to what do I owe this pleasure?

479
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,880
诺玛  我得开车去一趟
Norma, I had to make the drive

480
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,690
因为今早我拿到了上个月的报告
'cause I got last month's reports this morning,

481
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,410
我迫不及待想说给你听
and I was so excited to share them with you.

482
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,140
快说来听听
Tell me.

483
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:42,240
我们五家诺玛的双R分店中有三家
Three of our five Norma's Double R franchises

484
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,300
开始盈利了
turned a profit.

485
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,270
对这样一个新品牌来说这是个巨大的里程碑
And that's a huge milestone for such a new brand,

486
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,780
尤其目前整个地区的经济
particularly when this whole region

487
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,070
都还面临着艰巨的挑战
still faces such uphill challenges economically.

488
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,410
所以这是好消息吗
So that's good?

489
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,070
这是大好消息
That's very good.

490
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,490
看看这个...
Looking at what's...

491
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,650
奇怪的是
Curiously,

492
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,540
两个拖后腿的餐厅其中之一
one of the two that's lagging

493
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,270
就是这里
is this one right here--

494
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,990
你的旗舰店
your flagship diner.

495
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,510
现在这行情生意都会有点下滑的
Well, business always takes a little dip this time of year.

496
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,460
这已经持续几个月了
It's been going on for a few months now.

497
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:23,320
所以我擅自做了一个销售终端分析
So I took the liberty of running a point-of-sale analysis

498
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,400
将这里和其餐厅做了一个对比
between this location and the others.

499
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,730
我真的有点看不懂这个
I-I can't really decipher that.

500
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,820
你能直接告诉我这是什么意思吗
Could you just tell me what it means?

501
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,470
简单来说
In black and white,

502
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,740
你将派成本太高
you're spending too much per pie

503
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,810
收费不够
and not charging enough.

504
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,710
听着  沃尔特
Well, look, Walter,

505
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,440
我之前就想对你说  就是...
I wanted to say this to you before. It's--

506
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,360
我听别人说
I-I've heard from other people

507
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,870
他们觉得我们其它分店做的派
that they think that our pies at the other locations

508
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,230
没有我们这家好吃
are just not as good as the ones we have here.

509
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,040
我在听
I hear you.

510
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,320
但按照我们和每一家签的协议
And I gave them all my exact recipes,

511
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,800
我把全部的配方都给他们了
as per our agreement,

512
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,160
我觉得他们没有按照配方来
but I don't think they're following them.

513
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,600
诺玛  我向你保证
Norma, I assure you

514
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,590
他们完全是按你的配方来的  而且...
they're following your recipes to the letter, but also...

515
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,600
根据和每一家签的协议...
per the agreement...

516
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,910
他们可以自行决定在哪购买原料
Using their discretion about where they get the ingredients.

517
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,120
不对
Mm, no.

518
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,270
我所有的原料都是天然  有机的本地食材
All my ingredients are natural, organic, local.

519
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,250
我知道  你用爱在做这些派
I know. You make them with love.

520
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,290
但我们的协议就是如此
But this was our agreement.

521
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,370
诺玛...
Norma...

522
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,110
你是个真正的艺术家
you're a real artist.

523
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,800
但爱没法一直让我们盈利
But love doesn't always turn a profit.

524
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,220
我们百分之百相信你
We believe in you 100 percent,

525
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,120
但从商业角度来说
but from a business perspective,

526
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,320
董事会希望你能在不牺牲任何高标准的情况下
the board would like you to consider some alternatives

527
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,610
考虑下其它选择
without sacrificing any of the high standards

528
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,920
而这些标准正是你的金字招牌
that you're so well-known for.

529
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,530
好吧  要是你能说一下有哪些选择
Well, if you can explain the alternatives,

530
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,940
我会考虑一下的
I'll--I'll look into it.

531
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,850
我一点儿也不想泼你冷水
Well, look, I-I don't mean to sound discouraging one little bit.

532
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,740
这是个大好消息
This is all good news.

533
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,240
就是稍微调整下配方
It's just about tweaking the formula

534
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,830
维持菜品的高水准并保持盈利
to ensure consistency and profitability.

535
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,160
举个例子
For instance,

536
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,610
我们觉得现在应该把餐厅名字改为
we think it's really time you changed this name

537
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,460
诺玛的双R
to Norma's Double R.

538
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,260
知道吗  沃尔特  在双峰镇
You know, Walter, in Twin Peaks,

539
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,470
双R这个名字已经有50多年的历史了
it's been the Double R Diner for over 50 years,

540
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,260
这才是大家熟悉的名字
and that's how people know it.

541
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,730
双R是没有什么不好
No disrespect to the Double R,

542
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,030
但你会记起我们的市场调查表明
but you'll recall our market research showed

543
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,160
你的名字在大家心中反响更大
people responded so much more favorably to your name--

544
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,290
餐厅就应该叫诺玛的双R
Norma's Double R, as it should be.

545
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,660
你是分店的形象代言人
You're the face of the franchise.

546
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,380
待会共进晚餐吗
Are we on for dinner later?

547
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,470
庆祝
To celebrate?

548
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,180
是的  沃尔特
Yes, Walter.

549
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,070
那...
So...

550
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,910
好吧  为了防止...
Okay, so, just in case...

551
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,470
抱歉  我们打烊了
I'm sorry. We're closed.

552
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,570
天啊
Oh, my God!

553
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,710
雅各比医生
Dr. Jacoby.

554
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,530
娜丁
Nadine.

555
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,520
-是你吗  -是我
- Is that you? - It's me.

556
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,560
我能叫你安普博士吗
Can I call you Dr. Amp?

557
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,230
就是我
That's me.

558
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,050
我一般都会忽略后面
I usually leave out the back.

559
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,540
天啊
Oh, my God!

560
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,790
我太喜欢你的节目了
I love your show so much.

561
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,380
你为我做了太多
You have done so much for me.

562
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,270
我喜欢你的橱窗展示
Well, I love your-- your window display.

563
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,130
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

564
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,530
-天啊  -你真的喜欢吗
- Oh, my God. - Do you really like it?

565
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,900
太了不起了
It--it's magnificent.

566
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,340
那些窗帘一点声音也没有
And those drapes are completely silent.

567
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,790
这是我在向你致敬  安普博士
This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.

568
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,010
多亏了你
Thanks to you,

569
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:32,940
我真的开始把自己从屎里铲出来
I am really starting to shovel myself out of the shit!

570
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,830
娜丁
Oh, Nadine.

571
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,040
这对我意义非凡
That--that just means the world to me.

572
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,930
真的
It really does.

573
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,870
你  知道吗  这...
You--you know, it's--

574
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,900
这是我们和他们之间的较量
it's us against them.

575
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,300
我就是最忠诚的步兵
And I am your most loyal foot soldier...

576
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,720
或者...
or...

577
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,660
铲屎官
shoveler.

578
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,670
知道吗   上次我见你
You know, the... last--last time I saw you,

579
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,260
都是大约七年前了
it was about seven years ago.

580
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,250
你...
You...

581
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,510
你趴在地上
You were down on your hands and knees,

582
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,570
找一个土豆
looking for a potato.

583

Where was I?

584

在超市
It was, uh, you know, in the supermarket.

585

你弄掉了一个土豆
You--you had dropped it.

586

那天刮着大风暴
It--There was a... a big storm that day.

587
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,570
右手打中了大个子的耳朵
Oh, the right hand catches the big guy by the ear!

588
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,690

And he finally goes down, hangs onto the ropes.

589
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,220
那位先生问他有没有事
Oh, the gentleman asks him if he's okay.

590
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,670
看上去第一回合和第二回合就要开始了
Looks like, uh, round number one and two under way.

591
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,630

628
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,590
奥黛丽
Audrey...

629
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,550
我们说好了的
we've been over this.

630
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,780
告诉我
Tell me!

631
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,430
奥黛丽
Audrey.

632
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,880
别闹了
Stop it.

633
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,840
我...
I d--

634
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,740
我觉得我自己根本不在这里
I feel like I'm somewhere else.

635
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,760
你有过这种感觉吗  查理
Have you ever had that feeling, Charlie?

636
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,590
没有
No.

637
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,370
感觉我在别处  感觉我不是自己
Like I'm somewhere else and--and like I'm somebody else.

638
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,050
你有过这种感觉吗
Have you ever felt that?

639
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,490
没有
No.

640
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,080
我感觉我一直是自己
I always feel like myself.

641
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,090
也许这并不算最好的状态
And it may not always be the best feeling.

642
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,420
我不知道我是谁  但我肯定不是我自己
Well, I'm not sure who I am, but I'm not me.

643
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:04,570
这是存在主义第一课
This is Existentialism 101.

644
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,240
操
Oh, fuck you!

645
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,090
我是认真的
I'm serious!

646
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,060
除了我自己  我还能相信谁
Who am I supposed to trust but myself?

647
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,900
我还不知道我自己是谁
And I don't even know who I am!

648
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,470
那我该怎么办
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?

649
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,810
你应该去酒馆
You're supposed to go to the Roadhouse

650
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,610
看看比利在不在那里
and see if Billy is there.

651
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,520
我想是的
I guess.

652
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,270
远吗
Is it far?

653
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,440
得了吧  奥黛丽  你知道在哪里
Come on, Audrey, you know where it is.

654
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,050
要不是我了解你  我肯定觉得你嗑药了
If I didn't know better, I would swear you were on drugs.

655
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,260
到底在哪里
Just where is it?

656
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,360
我送你去
I'm gonna take you there.

657
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,620
你还要继续玩下去吗
Now, are you gonna stop playing games,

658
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,150
还是说由我结束你编的故事
or do I have to end your story, too?

659
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,950
什么故事  查理
What story is that, Charlie?

660
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:02,100
是住在路口的小姑娘的故事吗
Is that the story of the little girl who lived down the lane?

661
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,010
是吗
Is it?

662
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,730
是你想去的
You're the one that wanted to go.

663
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,500
现在你看起来好像想留下来
Now you're looking like you want to stay.

664
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,210
我想留下也想走
I want to stay, and I want to go.

665
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,340
我都想
I want to do both.

666
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,650
选哪个  查理
Which will it be, Charlie?

667
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,140
你会选哪个
Which one would you be?

668
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,390
查理  帮帮我
Charlie, help me.

669
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,500
这里就像是鬼城
It's like Ghostwood here.

670
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,790
枪炮酒吧

671
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,760

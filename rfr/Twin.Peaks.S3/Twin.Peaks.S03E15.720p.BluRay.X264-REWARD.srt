娜丁
Nadine?

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,360
艾德  我是过来跟你说点事的
Ed, I've come to tell you something.

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,170
亲爱的  你的车呢  你怎么过来的
Honey, where's your car? How'd you get here?

23
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,270
-我走过来的  -你走来的
- I walked. - You walked?

24
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,680
你拿着铲子干什么
What's with the shovel?

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,540
我正想跟你说这个
That's what I want to talk to you about.

26
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,650
-是吗  -是的
- It is? - Yes.

27
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,350
艾德  我来是想告诉你
Ed, I've come to tell you

28
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,390
我已经变了
I've changed.

29
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,630
是吗
You have?

30
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,970
是的  艾德  你知道我很爱你
Yes, and Ed, you know I love you so much...

31
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,310
我知道  娜丁
I know you do, Nadine.

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,820
但我这么多年来一直对你很糟
But I've been a selfish bitch to you all these years,

33
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,780
而你一直都是个圣人
and you've been a saint.

34
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,610
什么
What?

35
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,640
听我说
Listen to me.

36
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,220
我一直都知道你爱诺玛她也爱你
I've known since forever you love Norma and she loves you.

37
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,590
因为我的嫉妒让你们分离
I kept the two of you apart because of my jealousy.

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,090
我操纵了你  艾德
And I manipulated you, Ed.

39
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,910
不不  你没有  娜丁
No, no, you haven't, Nadine.

40
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,600
不  你知道这是真的
Oh, no, you know it's true.

41
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,580
我让你觉得愧疚而留在我身边
I guilted you to stay,

42
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,850
而你太好了  真的留了下来
and you're so good you stayed

43
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,280
放弃了自己的爱情
and gave up your love.

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,520
天呐  艾德
Oh, god, Ed,

45
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,390
我希望你能自由
I want you to be free.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,310
我现在很好
I'm fine now.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,740
你问拿这把铲子怎么了
You asked about this shovel.

48
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,490
我正把自己从屎里铲出来
Well, I'm shoveling myself out of the shit.

49
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,150
你一直在看雅各比的节目吗
Have you been watching that show of Jacoby's?

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,800
那是当然
You know I have.

51
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,100
娜丁...
Nadine...

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,200
别担心我了
Don't worry about me.

53
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,160
去找她吧
Run to her.

54
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,190
好好与她相守到老吧
Enjoy the rest of your lives together.

55
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,610
我太开心了
I am so happy

56
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,110
只要一想到你们俩幸福地在一起
Just thinking of you two being happy.

57
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,450
艾德  我爱你  永远都爱
Ed, I love you and always will,

58
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,810
但真爱就是要让对方幸福
but true love is giving the other what makes them happy.

59
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,130
天呐
Jeez,

60
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,510
你这个大块头
you big lug,

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,370
太美好了
how beautiful is this!

62
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,670
娜丁  我希望你认真思考下
Nadine, I want you to think real hard about

63
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,660
你刚说的话  因为你不知道自己在说什么
what you're saying because you're not making any sense.

64
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,520
亲爱的  明天你就会希望
Honey, tomorrow, you're gonna wish

65
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,540
你从没说过这些话
you never said these things.

66
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,630
艾德  我说过了
Ed, I told you,

67
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,260
我走了大老远过来
I walked all the way here.

68
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,420
我有足够的时间思考  反悔
I had plenty of time to think, turn back,

69
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,540
但我没有
but I didn't

70
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,850
因为我真的是这么想的
because this is how I really feel.

71
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,030
你可以谢谢安普医生
And you can thank Dr. Amp,

72
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,220
我们的老朋友  雅各比医生
our old friend, Dr. Jacoby.

73
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,050
对我来说  他大概就是这里唯一一个
To me, he's about the only one around here

74
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,740
有一说一的人了
telling it like it is.

75
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,780
所以  就是这样
So, it's just it is.

76
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,330
艾德  你自由了
Ed, you are free.

77
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,030
去享受生活吧
Go and enjoy.

78
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:37,640
双R餐厅

79
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,160
诺玛  所有事都改变了
Norma, everything has changed.

80
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,980
我刚跟娜丁聊过了
I just spoke with Nadine.

81
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,270
她给了我自由
She's given me my freedom.

82
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,830
艾德  我...
Ed, I'm--

83
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,480
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

84
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,140
沃尔特在这里
Walter's here.

85
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,650
-你收到我的花了吗  -很美...
- Did you get my flowers? - Oh, lovely...

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
你要点什么  艾德
What can I get you, Ed?

87
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,500
一杯咖啡
Cup of coffee.

88
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,640
马上送上
Coming right up.

89
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,460
还要一片毒药
And a cyanide tablet.

90
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,590
我要你过来一趟
So I asked you to stop by

91
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,510
因为我有事要跟你说
because I have something to tell you.

92
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,390
你决定把餐厅改名为诺玛的双R餐厅了
You're changing the name to Norma's Double R.

93
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,730
我就知道你会改变心意的
I knew you'd come around.

94
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,960
不是的  其实是...
No, actually, um,

95
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,270
我在考虑让你出钱买断我的股份
I'm exercising my option for you to buy me out.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,790
什么
What?

97
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,160
你是在开玩笑吗
Is this a joke?

98
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,190
不是  我是认真的  沃尔特
No, you heard me, Walter.

99
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,660
为什么
But why?

100
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,660
家庭原因
Family reasons.

101
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,230
你不是说你没有家人吗
I thought you told me you didn't have any family?

102
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,030
不  我有一个非常美满的家庭
No, I have a wonderful family.

103
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,500
我想照顾家人
And I want to take care of them.

104
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,260
我太操劳了  总是在操心餐厅的事
I just spread myself too thin, worrying about all these diners.

105
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,660
我想在家庭上多花点时间
I...I want to spend more time at home.

106
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,620
给你
Here you go.

107
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,380
诺玛  我尊重你的决定
Norma, I respect your decision,

108
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,250
尽管我并不是很理解
even if I don't understand it.

109
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,730
我只是很遗憾你将错过
I'm just sorry you're not going to be part

110
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,100
这巨大的成功了
of what is going to be a great success.

111
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,420
我知道会大获成功的
Oh, and I know it will be,

112
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,140
我希望你们一切顺利  沃尔特
and I-I wish you the best of luck, Walter.

113
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,570
但是...
But...

114
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,240
我看了看我的合同
I looked at my contract.

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
我会按合同保留这家双R
I'm gonna keep the Double R as agreed,

116
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,990
你要买下我其它的分店的股份
and you're gonna buy my shares of the other franchises.

117
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,930
很快就有七家了
Soon to be seven.

118
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,000
七家生意兴隆  宾至如归的餐厅
Seven diners full of happy, satisfied customers.

119
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,870
我有一家就很开心
And I'm happier with just one.

120
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,070
坦白地讲
For the record,

121
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,870
我只想说
I'd just like to say,

122
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,540
你在犯一个大错误
you're making a huge mistake.

123
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,330
我觉得你会后悔的
And I believe you're going to regret it.

124
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,470
嫁给我
Marry me.

125
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,960
当然
Of course I will.

126
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,530
咖啡店

127
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,720
我在找菲利普·杰弗里斯
I'm looking for Phillip Jeffries.

128
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,150
我会帮你开门

129
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,890
是你啊
Oh, it's you.

130
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,260
杰弗里斯
Jeffries.

131
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,540
感谢上帝
Thank God.

132
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,060
为什么你派雷来杀我
Why did you send Ray to kill me?

133
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,860
什么
What?

134
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,180
我打过给雷
I called Ray.

135
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,380
真的是你派他去的
So you did send him?

136
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,600
你五天前打过电话给我吗
Did you call me five days ago?

137
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,930
我没有你的号码
I don't have your number.

138
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,840
所以说别人打给我的吗
So it was someone else who called me?

139
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,090
我们以前常常聊天
We used to talk.

140
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,110
是的
Yes, we did.

141
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,120
现在
Well, now,

142
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,160
我不想聊朱迪
I'm not gonna talk about Judy.

143
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,330
事实上  我们根本不会聊朱迪
In fact, we are not gonna talk about Judy at all.

144
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,560
1989年
1989.

145
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,040
你出现在联调局费城总部
You showed up at FBI headquarters in Philadelphia

146
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,700
说你见过朱迪
and said you'd met Judy.

147
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,840
所以你是库柏吗
So, you are Cooper?

148
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,920

00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:32,160
该死
Oh, shit.

299
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,260
你等一下
Hold on.

300
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,070
嗯  解决一个  还剩一个
Yeah, one down, one to go.

301
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,200
好  薯条
Yeah, french fries.

302
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,810
多加番茄酱
And extra ketchup.

303
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,170
双峰警察局

304
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,990
把他关在八号
Put him in eight.

305
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,090
把他关在八号
Put him in eight.

306
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,900
转身
Back up.

307
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,710
那个戴手套的怪胎干了什么
What'd that gloved freak do now?

308
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,870
闭嘴  查德
Shut up, Chad!

309
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,650
闭嘴  查德
Shut up, Chad.

310
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,130
他在牢里做什么
What's he doing in the cell?

311
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,940
别理他
Don't pay any attention to him.

312
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,970
霍克
Hawk.

313
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,910
他们两个还好吗
Are those guys okay?

314
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,480
都在重症监护
Both in intensive care.

315
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,310
他们都在重症监护
They're both in intensive care.

316
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,240
搞什么
What the hell?

317
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,520
闭嘴
Shut up!

318
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,770
闭嘴
Shut up!

319
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,130
政府也经常这么做
The government does it all the time.

320
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,580
有人收钱做事  就和我们一样
People get paid for it, too, just like us.

321
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,040
说的没错
Damn right.

322
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,860
虚伪的混账
Two-faced fucks.

323
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,680
说什么基督教国家
So-called Christian nation.

324
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,200
还不如说
Might as well be

325
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,390
"汝应杀人"
"Thou shalt kill."

326
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,820
"绝不怜悯"  "拒绝原谅"
"Show no mercy." "Forgive no one."

327
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,420
去他们的
Fuck 'em in the ass.

328
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,370
这是杀人凶手的国度  到处杀人
It's a nation of killers, killing all along.

329
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,310
几乎屠杀了所有的印第安人  可不是吗
Killed damn near all the Indians, didn't they?

330
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,520
是啊
Yeah.

331
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,420
但是我杀了人之后乐趣就结束了
But my fun's over when we actually kill someone.

332
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,010
虐待尸体没意思
It's no fun torturing a corpse.

333
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,220
我已经几百年
I haven't got to torture anybody

334
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,580
没有虐待人了  哈齐
in a fuck of a long time, Hutch.

335
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,120
我知道
I know.

336
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,410
只是最近都没什么机会
Just hadn't worked out lately.

337
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,210
我操
It's fucked.

338
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,420
你知道我讨厌
You know I hate it

339
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,650
你拿这些小包番茄酱给我
when you get me these little ketchup packs.

340
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,870
对不起  他们只有这些
I'm sorry. It's all they had.

341
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,110
你有帮我带甜点吗
Did you get me dessert?

342
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,830
当然有
You know I did.

343
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,910
我爱你  哈齐
I love you, Hutch.

344
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,880
我爱你  香塔尔
I love you, Chantal.

345
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,590
今夜真美
Beautiful night.

346
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,880
火星
Mars.

347
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,650
这给你  道吉
Here you go, Dougie.

348
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,920
好不好吃
Is it delicious?

349
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,630
好吃
Delicious.

350
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
道吉
Oh, Dougie.

351
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,520
感觉我们的梦想都要成真了
It's like all our dreams are coming true.

352
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,820
真了
True.

353
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,470
再见  诺玛
Good-bye, Norma.

354
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,770
看看他们能做些什么
We'll see what they can do.

355
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,600
我不担心  一切都会没事的
I'm not worried. Everything will be fine.

356
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,490
原班人马再次集结
The old team together again.

357
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,700
没什么能阻止我们
Nothing can stop us.

358
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,790
原班人马  没错
The old team. Yeah.

359
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,490
-再见  亲爱的  -再见  德米尔先生
- Good-bye, dear. - Good-bye, Mr. Demille.

360
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,220
怎么样
How'd it go?

361
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,600
进展得非常顺利
It couldn't have gone better.

362
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,820
基本都好了
It's practically set.

363
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,690
他得先完成这幅画
Good he has to finish this picture first.

364
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,790
我的就是下一个
Mine will be his next.

365
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,640
去找戈登·科尔
Get Gordon Cole.

366
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,450
告诉他别管我们的车了
Tell him to forget about our car.

367
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,590
告诉他可以随便再搞一辆旧车
Tell him he can get another old car someplace--

368
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,170
妈妈  怎么回事
Mom, what was that?

369
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,740
霍克副局长  霍克副局长
Deputy Hawk? Deputy Hawk?

370
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,070
玛格丽特·兰特曼一号线呼叫
Margaret Lanterman's on line one.

371
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,830
好的  露西
Okay, Lucy.

372
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,960
玛格丽特  有什么事吗
Margaret, what can I do for ya?

373
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,500
霍克
Hawk.

374
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,590
我快死了
I'm dying.

375
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,170
我很遗憾  玛格丽特
I'm sorry, Margaret.

376
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,070
你了解死亡
You know about death,

377
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,810
这只是一种变数
That it's just a change,

378
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,520
不是终结
not an end.

379
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,770
霍克
Hawk.

380
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,980
时间到了
It's time.

381
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,240
还是有些恐惧
There's some fear,

382
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,490
恐惧这么放下
some fear in letting go.

383
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,690
记得我跟你说过的话
Remember what I told you.

384
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,260
我在电话里不能再多说了
I can't say more over the phone.

385
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,850
但你知道我的意思
But you know what I mean,

386
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,550
从我们的谈话
from our talks,

387
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,580
我们之前能面对面交流的时候
when we were able to speak face to face.

388
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,050
小心那个
Watch for that one,

389
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,690
那个我和你说过的
the one I told you about,

390
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,440
月光下
the one under the moon

391
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,200
蓝色松林山上的那个
on blue pine mountain.

392
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,340
霍克
Hawk.

393
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,720
我的木头变成金色了
My log is turning gold.

394
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,780
风在呼啸
The wind is moaning.

395
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,340
我要死了
I'm dying.

396
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,910
晚安  霍克
Good night, Hawk.

397
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,320
晚安  玛格丽特
Good night, Margaret.

398
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,220
再见  玛格丽特
Good-bye, Margaret.

399
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,170
出什么事了
What's up?

400
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,190
霍克找我们的
Hawk intercommed us,

401
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,340
要我们来这里见他
told us to meet him here.

402
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,450
玛格丽特·兰特曼今晚去世了
Margaret Lanterman passed away tonight.

403
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,940
木头女士死了
The log lady's dead?

404
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,850
我不想再等电话了
I'm just tired of waiting for the phone.

405
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,140
比利讨厌那个地方  但是...
Billy hated that place, but...

406
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,090
你穿上了你的外套
Oh. You got your coat on.

407
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,650
当然了
Of course I do.

408
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,350
我们要出去
We're going out.

409
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,880
我们要去酒馆
We're going to the roadhouse.

410
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,340
我需要我的外套
I will need my coat.

411
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,850
是啊  我...
Yeah, well, yeah, I just...

412
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,690
你可真麻烦  查理
You're really something, Charlie.

413
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,490
搞什么
What the hell?

414
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,780
穿上你的外套  奥黛丽
Put your coat on, Audrey.

415
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,730
已经很晚了  我很困
It's already late and I'm so sleepy.

416
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,720
我们走
Let's go.

417
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,450
你能别抱怨了吗
Would you just stop complaining?

418
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,160
天啊  你真是烦人
God, what a pain in the ass you are.

419
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,780
你就不能闭上你的嘴巴
I mean, can't you just do something for someone else

420
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,050
帮别人做事的时候别满腹怨言吗
without ruining it by continually complaining?

421
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,490
你真是爱抱怨  就像一只有病的小狗
You're such a whiner, it's like being with a sick dog.

422
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,330
你要穿上外套
Are you gonna put your coat on

423
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,900
还是要这样把我烦死
or talk me to death right here, on the threshold?

424
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,450
比利和我出门的时候
You know, when Billy and I go places,

425
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,050
从来不会像你这样和我说话  查理
he never speaks to me the way you do, Charlie.

426
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,570
没错
Yes.

427
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,920
我是查理
Well, I am Charlie

428
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,950
他是比利
and he is Billy.

429
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,720
我更喜欢比利
And I like Billy better.

430
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,770
太感性了
Sensational.

431
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,990
你要不要穿上外套
Now, are you gonna put your coat on

432
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,390
还是说我们要在这里站一整晚
or shall we stand here all night?

433
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,060
又来了
Here you go again.

434
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,870
你就不能消停一会
You can't stop for one fucking second.

435
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,060
奥黛丽  说真的
Audrey, seriously,

436
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:22,500
再拖一秒  我就要脱掉外套
in one fucking second, I'm taking my coat off

437
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,710
今晚不出去了
and staying in for the night.

438
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,120
想去酒馆的是你
You're the one that wanted to go to the roadhouse,

439
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,200
不是我
Not me.

440
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,760
真是不可能
It's impossible.

441
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,930
就这样在我眼前
I mean, I see it right before my eyes,

442
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,310
但我以前竟然都没发现
but I never really saw it before.

443
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,320
真是太不可能了
It's absolutely fucking impossible.

444
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,980
又怎么了  奥黛丽
What is it now, Audrey?

445
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,610
你  查理  是你
You, Charlie, it's you.

446
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,700
我以前从来没发现
I-I-I just never really saw you before

447
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,010
你是这样的人
the way I'm seeing you now.

448
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,850
好像变得完全不一样了
Like I'm meeting a different person.

449
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,030
你是谁  查理
Who are you, Charlie?

450
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:06,650
好吧  脱掉外套
Okay, off comes the coat.

451
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,750
你怎么能这样
How can you be like this?

452
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,710
我恨你这个混蛋
I hate your fucking guts!

453
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,150
我恨你
I hate you!

454
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,340
你知道我有多恨你吗
Do you know how much I fucking hate you?

455
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:36,150
枪炮酒吧

456
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,250
我在等人
I'm waiting for someone.

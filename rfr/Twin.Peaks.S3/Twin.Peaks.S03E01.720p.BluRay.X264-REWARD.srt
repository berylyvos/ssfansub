最高机密
Top secret.

66
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,190
那我更好奇了  你快把我逼疯了
Now I'm so curious. You're driving me crazy.

67
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,800
我得进去了
In fact, I got to go back in.

68
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,180
我明天来上班的时候去你那  如果可以的话
I'll stop by on my way in tomorrow, if I can.

Try me.

77
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,460
贝弗莉
Beverly,

78
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,570
告诉豪斯曼女士

79
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,750
我们会退她两晚的住宿金

80
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,300
但一整周可不行

81
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,750
她和她纽约的朋友们
She and her New York friends

82
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,680
一直使用着我们的按摩馆呢

83
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:00,850
好的
Good.

84
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,830
臭鼬到底怎么进到她房间里的
How did the skunk get in her room?

85
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,620
什么
What's that?

86
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,460
臭鼬
The--the,  skunk,

87
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,380
怎么进到她房间里的
how did it get into her room?

88
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,320
不  没有
No, no, no, no.

89
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
根本就没
It--it wasn't even--

90
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,180
都没靠近她房间
even close to her room.

91
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,160
臭鼬在酒店的另一头
The skunk was on the whole other side of the hotel.

92
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,410
-是...  -我来了
- It was... - I am here,

93
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,670
本老弟
Brother Ben!

94
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,910
酸酸甜甜
Sweet and sour,

95
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,430
带点咸  很松脆
salty, crunchy...

96
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,740
贝弗莉
Beverly,

97
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,840

你好  很高兴见到你
Hi. Nice to meet you.

当然
Sure thing.

102
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,250
那个是新来的女孩吗
Is that the new girl?

103
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,630
还是我应该称呼为"女人"
Or should I say "Woman"?

104
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,620
那样的一个女人你不能称之为女孩
A woman like that, you can't call a girl.

105
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,170
贝弗莉  是的
Beverly, yes.

106
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,920
你上她了吗
Are you banging her yet?

107
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,850
杰瑞
Jerry!

108
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,250
尊  重
R-e-s-p-e-c-t.

109
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,330
尊重
Respect.

110
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,960
她是一个美丽的灵魂
She's a beautiful soul.

111
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,490
而且她结婚了
And she's married.

112
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,440
以前你可不介意这个
That never stopped you before.

113
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,750
给我吧  给我吧  给我吧  给我吧
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

114
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,400
杰瑞
Jerry.

115
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,740
你脑子里还能有什么
What else do you have on your mind?

116
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,490
实际上我在神游
Swimming in my mind at this time, literally,

117
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,580
思绪从我最新研究的水栽籼粳混合稻
is my new hydroponic indica-sativa hybrid,

118
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,610
一路通过阿姆斯特丹快速通道
a touch of the mythic AK-47

119
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,850
跑到神秘的AK47
by way of the Amsterdam express.

120
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,160
它被烘焙成了香蕉面包
It's baked into this banana bread

121
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,330
又被灌入了这个可以抹平的果酱之中
and infused in this potent spreadable jam

122
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,550
这对于孤独的创造者来说再理想不过了
that's ideal for creative sojourns of a solitary nature.

123
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,990
思绪泛滥
Wheels up.

124
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,080
杰瑞
Jerry,

125
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,980
吃自家旅馆东西的创始人
a prophet is without honor

126
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,610
是不会获得别人的尊敬的
who eats his own profits.

127
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,060
那可不对  本老弟
Not indeed, brother Ben.

128
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,790
这让我状态正佳
It puts me in a groove,

129
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,180
没有人知道我什么时候会累
and where it stops, nobody knows.

130
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,500
感谢上帝你再也不插手宾馆的工作了
Thank God you are no longer in the hotel business.

131
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,180
你怎么了  本
Where have you been, Ben?

132
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,800
我的最新合规合法的业务
Yeah, my new legally sanctioned business

133
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,250
是把我们的税收翻三倍
is tripling our revenue.

134
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,020
这是妈妈的帽子吗
Is that Mother's hat?

135
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,820
双峰警察局

136
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,720
露西·布伦南

137
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,480
你好  我想找杜鲁门警长
Hello. I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.

138
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,610
哪一个
Which one?

139
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,810
哪一个
Which one?

140
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,720
杜鲁门警长不在吗
Sheriff Truman isn't here?

141
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,160
你知道哪一个吗
Well, do you know which one?

142
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,010
可能会弄错
It could make a difference.

143
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,480
不  女士
No, ma'am.

144
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,280
一个生病了
One is sick,

145
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,140
另一个去钓鱼了
and the other one is fishing.

146
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,100
可能会弄错
It could make a difference.

147
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,330
是关于保险的
It's about insurance.

148
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,910
我不确定我能否帮上你
I'm not sure I will be able to help you.

149
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,550
我要见杜鲁门警长
I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.

150
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,750
我会留下我的名片
I'll leave my card

151
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,440
改天再打电话来
and call in another day.

152
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,470
谢谢
Thank you.

153
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,980
我会留好名片的
I'll keep the card,

154
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,100
但是除非
but unless--

155
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,030
你以为你在往哪里走
Where the hell do you think you're going?

156
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,030
瞧瞧
Well, lookee here.

157
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,320
奥蒂斯
Otis.

158
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,740
你好  比尤拉
Hello, Buella.

159
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,370
你好吗
How you?

160
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,400
比尤拉
Buella,

161
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,910
雷和达雅
Ray and Darya--

162
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,600
你把他们带回来了吗
have you got them back there somewhere?

163
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,070
我去叫他们
I'll get 'em.

164
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,020
还有  比尤拉
And, Buella,

165
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,180
装饰一下你的前门吧
put something better at your front door.

166
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,000
世界上都是卡车司机
It's a world of truck drivers.

167
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,610
雷
Ray!

168
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,080
达雅
Darya!

169
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,310
雷
Ray,

170
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,430
达雅
Darya,

171
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,630
我们走
let's go.

172
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,620
C先生  C先生
Mr. C. Mr. C.

173
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,220
再见  奥蒂斯
See ya, Otis.

174
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,440
特雷茜
Hey, Tracey.

175
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,340
他不在这里
He's not here.

176
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,220
没人在这里
No one is here.

177
00:25:59,130 --> 00:25:59,890
真的吗
Really?

178
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,170
好奇怪
Weird.

179
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,050
他去哪儿了
Where is he?

180
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,430
这说明我可以
Does this, by any chance,

181
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,620
跟你一起进去吗
mean that I can go in there with you?

182
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,900
我又带了两杯拿铁来
I brought us two lattes again.

183
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,060
那么
Well,

184
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,540
既然没人来阻止你
since there's no one here to stop you,

185
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,840
我想你可以进来一会
I guess you could come in for a little while.

186
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,220
但我不知道如果保安回来
But I don't know how you're gonna get out

187
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,790
你要怎么出去
if the guard comes back.

188
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,850
我们先别去想这种可能性
Let's not overthink this opportunity.

189
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,390
那是什么
What is that thing?

190
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,830
一个玻璃箱
A glass box.

191
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,980
但是用来做什么呢
Yeah, but what's it for?

192
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,860
我真的不知道
I really don't know.

193
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,870
只是我帮学校做的一个活
It's just a job I got to help with school.

194
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,070
这地方是谁的
Whose place is this?

195
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,240
听说是个亿万富翁的
I heard a billionaire.

196
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,290
某个匿名富翁
Some anonymous billionaire.

197
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,350
好神秘啊
Mysterious.

198
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,800
我得留心观察这个箱子
I'm supposed to watch the box

199
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,100
以防里面出现些什么
and see if anything appears inside.

200
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,950
什么
What?

201
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,490
会有东西出现吗
Do things appear?

202
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,490
从开始到现在  我什么都没看到
I haven't seen anything since I started.

203
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,710
但是我取代的这个人
But the guy I replaced,

204
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,090
他看到过一次
he saw something once.

205
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,350
什么
What?

206
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,490
他不肯告诉我
He wouldn't tell me.

207
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,640
或是不能告诉我
Or couldn't tell me.

208
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,530
我们不该说起这个地方
We're not supposed to say anything about this place

209
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,890
或是那个玻璃箱
or that glass box.

210
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,460
好多设备
It's a lot of equipment.

211
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,660
是不是某种科学实验
Is it some sort of science experiment

212
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,790
或是类似的东西
or something like that?

213
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,410
我想你也可以这么说吧
I guess you could say that.

214
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,050
你要不要坐下
Do you want to sit down?

215
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,440
好
Okay.

216
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,620
很舒服
Cozy.

217
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,880
给  你的咖啡
Here's your coffee.

218
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,910
谢谢你  特雷茜
Thanks, Tracey.

219
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,150
你要不要亲热一会
Do you want to make out a little?

220
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,970
你觉得呢
What do you think?

221
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,470
停下
Stop.

222
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,550
怎么了
What?

223
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,370
南达科他州鹿角镇

224
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,670
怎么了  阿姆斯特朗
What is it, Armstrong?

225
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:09,990
露丝
Ruth.

226
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,160
露丝  你在里面吗
Ruth, are you in there?

227
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,280
我的老天爷
My goodness.

228
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,920
我们走  走吧  阿姆斯特朗
Come on. Come on, Armstrong.

229
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,930
走  阿姆斯特朗
Come on, Armstrong.

230
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,650
走
Come on.

231
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,070
来  阿姆斯特朗  来
Come on, Armstrong. Come on.

232
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,250
来  小乖乖
Come on, little you.

233
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,980
好
Yeah.

234
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,320
天呐
By golly.

235
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,410
喂
Yes, hello?

236
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,270
你们不认识我
Yeah, you don't know me.

237
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,880
我叫玛乔丽·格林
This is-- this is Marjorie Green.

238
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,830
但是我的邻居不对劲
But my neighbor, there's something wrong.

239
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,500
我三天没见到她了
Yeah,  I haven't seen her in three days.

240
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,440
然后有一股难闻的气味
Oh, and then there's that terrible smell.

241
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,320
阿姆斯特朗闻到了
And Armstrong smelled it in the--

242
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,200
然后我闻到了  不是
Then I smelled it-- No.

243
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,950
不是  阿姆斯特朗是我的狗
No, Armstrong's my dog.

244
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,090
不是  我的地址吗
No-- Oh, my address?

245
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,670
我不知道
I-I-I don't know.

246
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,230
老天爷
My goodness.

247
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,050
是  我知道的
Yes,  I know this.

248
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,460
我知道的
You know, I know this.

249
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,020
太好笑了
It was a funny thing.

250
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,560
我打电话给你们的时候
I couldn't remember my address

251
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,030
我不记得我的地址了
when I called you on the phone.

252
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,290
臭味从哪发出来的  格林太太
Where's the smell coming from, Mrs. Green?

253
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,510
又来了
Oh, there it is again.

254
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,690
就是这股臭味
There's that smell.

255
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,600
女士  这里的管理员有钥匙吗
Ma'am, is there a manager on-site with a key?

256
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,310
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

257
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,850
巴尼平时都在这里
Barney's usually here.

258
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,420
你要我去找找他吗
Do you want me to go check?

259
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,810
要的  女士  如果你不介意的话
Yes, ma'am, if you don't mind.

260
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,890
我刚想起来了
Oh. I just remembered.

261
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,380
巴尼不在这里
Barney's not here.

262
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,170
巴尼很幽默
He's a funny one, that Barney.

263
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,850
他现在医院
He's in the hospital,

264
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,910
不是普通的医院
not the regular hospital.

265
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,420
达琳
Hey, uh, Darlene,

266
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,280
派个开锁匠来箭头路1349号
we're gonna need a locksmith over at 1349 Arrowhead,

267
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,040
或许是1054号
possible 10-54.

268
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,510
不  不对  是1349号
No, no, 1349.

269
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,740
女士  谁住这间房
Ma'am, who lives in this apartment?

270
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,630
露丝  露丝·达文波特
That would be Ruth, Ruth Davenport.

271
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,500
我又想起一件事
And I just remembered something.

272
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,380
什么事  女士
What's that, ma'am?

273
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,160
巴尼每次离开镇子
When Barney's out of town,

274
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,080
都会把钥匙留给他兄弟
he leaves the keys with his brother.

275
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,270
他兄弟是谁
And who would that be?

276
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,290
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

277
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,960
我从来没见过
I've never met him.

278
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,010
但汉克认识他
But Hank would know him.

279
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,270
汉克是谁
Who's Hank?

280
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,240
巴尼的朋友  汉克·菲尔莫尔
Barney's friend, Hank Fillmore.

281
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,370
我们去哪儿能找到汉克
Where would we find Hank?

282
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,750
那个...
Oh, well...

283
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,970
这会儿我也不知道
I don't know right now.

284
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,550
他是我们这里的修理工
He's our maintenance man.

285
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,940
但我刚才看到他回来了
But I saw him out back a little while ago.

286
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,860
哈维
Harvey?

287
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,650
哈维  你个混蛋
Harvey, you son of a bitch!

288
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,480
你是汉克吗
Are you Hank?

289
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,660
你们搞什么鬼
What the hell?

290
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,150
我们是警察  菲尔莫尔先生
Police, Mr. Fillmore.

291
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,400
我们需要你的协助
We need your help.

292
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,990
是哈维叫你们来的吗
Did Harvey send you?

293
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,700
菲尔莫尔先生  我们急需
Mr. Fillmore, we need a key

294
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,620
露丝·达文波特的房间钥匙
for Ruth Davenport's apartment.

295
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,480
我们正在找巴尼的兄弟
We're trying to find Barney's brother.

296
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,270
谁告诉你们我正要去见奇普的
Well, who told you I was going to see Chip?

297
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,310
谁是奇普
Who's Chip?

298
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,060
巴尼的兄弟
That's Barney's brother.

299
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,600
我们要找奇普拿钥匙
We need a key from Chip.

300
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,840
我刚才正要去找他  但是
I was just on my way, but h--

301
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,990
你们是怎么知道的
how did you know?

302
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,360
你知道齐普的电话吗
Well, do you have a phone number for Chip?

303
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,860
不  不  不

也许露丝出镇了

309
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,180
为什么
Why?

310
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,910
实在是不好意思
Well, it would be a shame

311
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,590
因为她出远门的时候
'cause I'm supposed to water her plants

312
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,970
我会去帮她浇花
when she's out of town.

313
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,200
我有她房间钥匙

318
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,180
是你把条子叫过来的吗
Did you send the cops to my place of business?

319

哈维  哈维  别
Harvey-- Harvey, don't--

327
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,120
别恐吓我  哈维
don't threaten me, Harvey.

328
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,290
哈维
Harvey.

329
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,090

你有权保持沉默

400
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,150
成为呈堂证供

409
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,350

你真的不想接这个案子吗

433
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,180
他对你估计会更坦诚一点

你认不认识露丝·达文波特
Do you know a Ruth Davenport?

443
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,440
名字挺耳熟的

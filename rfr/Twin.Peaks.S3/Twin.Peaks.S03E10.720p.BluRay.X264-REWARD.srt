米里亚姆
Miriam.

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,380
走开  理查德
Go away, Richard!

21
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,480
听我说  我只想跟你谈谈
Hey, hey, I just want to talk to you.

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,990
我已经告诉警察了
I already told the police

23
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,270
你是撞了那孩子
it was you who ran over the little boy.

24
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,750
-你已经告诉警察了  -对
- You already told the police? - Yes!

25
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,210
别过来  理查德
Stay away, Richard!

26
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,410
你还告诉别人了吗
Tell anybody else?

27
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,770
没有
No.

28
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,500
但我不知道你怎么还没被捕
But I don't know why you're not arrested,

29
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,800
所以我还写了一封信
so I also wrote a letter.

30
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,090
什么意思  信
What do you mean, a letter?

31
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,800
我给警长写了一封信
I wrote a letter to the sheriff,

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,450
杜鲁门警长  而且寄出去了
Sheriff Truman, and mailed it,

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,190
把我知道的都告诉他了
telling him everything I know,

34
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,270
我还说  如果我出了什么事
and I told him if anything happens to me,

35
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,260
一定是你干的  所以  就是这样
it was you who did it, so... there!

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,350
今天寄的吗
Sent that letter today?

37
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,930
没错
That's right.

38
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,640
过来
Come here!

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,680
过来  过来
Come here! Come here!

40
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,950
快过来
Come here!

41
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,080
闭嘴
Shut up!

42
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,250
-查德  -怎么了
- Chad. - What's up?

43
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,670
听着  那贱人米里亚姆
Listen, that little bitch Miriam

44
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,890
今天给警长寄了一封信
sent a letter to the sheriff today.

45
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,080
你得截住那狗娘养的
You got to intercept that motherfucker.

46
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,010
那可没那么容易  理查德
Oh, that ain't gonna be real easy, Richard.

47
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,180
你真是个懦夫
What a pussy you are!

48
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,050
别让那信落到警长手里
Don't let that fucking letter get to the sheriff,

49
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,180
你这混蛋  不然我让你也不好过
you chickenshit, or I'll fuck you up bad.

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,470
这要求可不容易办到  伙计
You're asking a lot there, pal.

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,490
我试试
I'll try.

52
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,930
光试试可不够  混蛋
You do more than try, fuck face.

53
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,420
我要走了
I'm taking off.

54
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,420
*从这山谷中*
*From this valley*

55
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,810
*他们说*
*They say*

56
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,800
*你将要离去*
*You are leaving*

57
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,850
*我会想念你的明眸*
* I will miss your bright eyes *

58
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,350
*以及你的甜笑*
*And sweet smile*

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,420
*他们说*
*For they say*

60
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,740
*你将带走*
*You are taking*

61
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,600
*阳光*
*The sunshine*

62
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,690
*那将照亮*
*That will brighten*

63
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,360
*来坐到我身边*
*Come and sit by my side*

64
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,540
*亲爱的*
*Little darling*

65
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,310
*别犹豫*
*Do not hasten*

66
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,290
*跟我道别*
*To bid me adieu*

67
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,590
*只要记得*
*Just remember*

68
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,200
*红河谷...*
*That Red River Valley...*

69
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,210
该死
Fuck!

70
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,280
我要把这些破玩意儿都扔出去
I will throw all of this shit out the window.

71
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,750
别他妈跟我说话了
Quit fucking speaking to me,

72
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,760
我他妈干啥或者不干啥
and what I do or don't fucking do

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,000
轮不到你来管
doesn't concern you.

74
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,710
简直是他妈的噩梦
It's a fucking nightmare.

75
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,810
不用我废话废话
I don't tell you shit

76
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,690
比如你他妈为什么不要求加薪
like why the fuck you don't ask for a raise.

77
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,900
话说回来  你到底能赚多少钱
How much money do you make, anyways?

78
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,240
你连最低时薪都挣不到
You barely make minimum wage!

79
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,030
我们根本负担不起这破地方
We can't even afford this shit hole.

80
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,500
不用我多说  把这破地方打扫干净
I don't tell you to clean this fucking place up!

81
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,320
你他妈敢动一下试试
Don't you fucking move.

82
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,240
你他妈...
Don't you fucking...

83
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,530
听我说  听我说
Listen to me. Listen to me.

84
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,260
别他妈用那无辜的样子看着我
Don't you give me that fucking innocent look.

85
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,840
我很清楚你做了什么
I know exactly what you did.

86
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,770
一清二楚
Exactly what you did.

87

你他妈...该死
You fuck... Ah, shit...

88

89
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,380

90
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,830
很抱歉  对不起
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

91
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,550
我的天  罗德尼  让我看看
Jesus! Rodney, let me see that.

92
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,040
-没事的  -让我看看
- It's all right! - Let me see this.

93
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,290
坎迪
Candie!

94
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,670
你都干了些什么  坎迪
What the fuck did you do, Candie?

95
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
-放手  放手  -放开我
- Get off. Get off! - Keep off of me!

96
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,680
坎迪  你都...
Candie! What the...

97
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,260
-老天啊  -放轻松  放轻松
- Jesus Christ. - Easy. Easy.

98
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,480
没事了  没事了
It's all right. It's all right.

99
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,110
没事的
It's gonna be all right.

100
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,620
出了点血
Ah, it's bleeding a little bit.

101
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,850
没事吧  流血了吗
Is it all right? Is it bleeding?

102
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,350
我手上有血  在流血吗
I got blood. Is it bleeding?

103
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,480
放开他  坎迪  坎迪  坎迪
Get away, Candie! Candie! Candie!

104
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,870
坎迪  坎迪  让...
Candie! Candie, let--

105
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,950
道吉  请坐
Dougie, have a seat.

106
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,520
好吧  那就站着检查吧
All right. I'll, uh, examine you standing up.

107
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,910
总之  我说过了  本医生
Anyway, as I told you, Dr. Ben,

108
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,180
他是上个星期开始这样的
it started last week

109
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,810
道吉消失了三天后回来就这样了
when Dougie disappeared for three days.

110
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,360
他都错过了桑尼·吉姆的生日派对
He missed Sonny Jim's birthday party,

111
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,090
我们为这个派对准备了六个月
which we'd been planning for six months,

112
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,600
然后他就突然从赌场回了家
and then he shows up straight from the casino.

113
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,460
你知道他的赌博恶习
You know about his gambling problems

114
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,410
还有酗酒
and then the drinking,

115
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,370
酗酒和赌博相互滋长
and the drinking feeds the gambling and vice versa,

116
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,840
整件事就是个恶性循环
and the whole thing is just a downward spiral.

117
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,550
道吉  你最近有在健身吗
Dougie, have you been exercising?

118
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,130
健身
Exercising.

119
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,840
还有  你瘦了很多
You have lost a good amount of weight, also.

120
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,460
-还有  -咱们继续
- Also. - Go on.

121
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,180
他就是...  我说不好...
Well, he's just... I don't know...

122
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,170
有点行为奇怪
acting peculiar.

123
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,150
奇怪
Peeee-culiar.

124
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,440
不  别动  道吉  我得听听这里
Uh, no, no, no. Dougie, I got to listen here.

125
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,910
道吉  别动
Dougie. No.

126
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,110
听我说  不行  道吉  道吉
Listen. No, Dougie. Dougie.

127
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,630
好了
Okay.

128
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,250
这个...
Well...

129
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,450
道吉  你的心肺功能看上去非常棒
Dougie, your heart and lungs sound fantastic,

130
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,620
那我们来量量血压
so let's check your blood pressure.

131
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,770
他体重减了多少
How much weight has he lost?

132
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,260
我觉得他瘦了很多
I-I-I think he's lost a lot of weight.

133
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,990
不过是好的那种
In a good way.

134
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,410
没错
Oh, yes.

135
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,600
道吉  上次我见你时  你还是挺超重的
Dougie, last time I saw you, you were quite overweight.

136
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,810
重
Weight?

137
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,580
是的  超重  对身体不好
Yes. Overweight and, uh, headed for trouble.

138
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,940
100/70
One ten over 70.

139
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,740
你身体好极了
Perfect.

140
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,390
简直惊人
Remarkable.

141
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,460
简直惊人
Remarkable.

142
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,620
坎迪  坎迪  我没事了
Candie. Candie, I'm fine.

143
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,870
我挺好的  没事...
I-I'm okay. It's...

144
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,340
保罗  下一步我们怎么做
Paul, where do we go next?

145
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,950
掷骰子  希娜
Roll the dice, Sheena.

今日市区酒店发生的重大事件
major excitement at a downtown hotel today...

149
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,060
布拉德  布拉德
Brad. Brad!

150
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,110
-怎么了  -艾克被抓了
- Huh? - They got Ike.

151
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,920
"长钉"施泰特勒
"The Spike" Stadtler.

152
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,440
不是吧
No shit.

153
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,430
那个混蛋
That asshole.

154
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,870
艾克终于捅出大篓子了
Ike finally stepped on his dick.

155
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,110
布拉德  记得提醒我取消给艾克设置的提醒
Brad, remind me to call off that hit on Ike.

156
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,650
给我们省了不少事  太好了
Save us a whack o' dough. Nice!

157
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,780
施泰特勒涉嫌多起与黑帮有关的谋杀案
Stadtler is a suspect in a number of gangland-related murders,

158
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,900
包括昨天的一起
including an attempt just yesterday

159
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,710
企图谋杀本地商人
on the life of this local businessman,

160
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,670
道吉·琼斯先生的案子
Mr. Douglas Jones.

161
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,120
受害者  才不是
Victim? Oh, no.

162
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,020
那个人看起来一点也不像受害者
That guy didn't act like any victim.

163
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,380
道格拉斯·琼斯  他的动作如眼镜蛇般迅速
Douglas Jones, he moved like a cobra.

164
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,350
我只看到了一个影子闪过
All I saw was a blur.

165
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,590
然后我们下了楼  我正牵着道吉
Then we came down, and I was holding on to Dougie.

166
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,290
我们在和平常一样说话
We were having a regular conversation

167
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,340
谈论着他的钱和保险  然后
about his money and insurance and-and--

168
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,860
别  道吉  不能这么做
No, Dougie, don't do that.

169
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,510
我们只是路过
And we were just walking along,

170
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,870
聊着私事  我拉着他
minding our own business, and I held on to him,

171
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,470
然后  不知从哪窜出来一个人径直朝向我们
and then, out of nowhere, someone came right at us,

172
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,390
手里拿着把枪
pointing a gun at my husband,

173
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,510
我们就...  道吉
and we were just-- Dougie!

174
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,710
他开始...  枪掉了
He wa--he started-- the gun went off,

175
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,690
吓死我了  也吓坏了我的道吉
and it scared me, and my Dougie,

176
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,160
他给他喉咙上来了个漂亮的空手切
he gave him a good old karate chop in the throat,

177
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,690
我还打了他几拳
and I punched him a couple times.

178
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,450
我说  "你少敢碰...  放开他
I said, "Don't you touch-- just get off him!

179
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,610
放开他"  然后我们...  他就跑了
Get off him!" And then we--he ran off!

180
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,110
我不知道他从哪跑出来的  这一切...
I don't know where he went, and it was... it was just--

181
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,250
这里暂停一下
Freeze it there.

182
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,530
你只是在尽本职工作  对吗  道吉
You just took care of business, right, Doug--

183
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,040
这就是我们的头彩先生  罗德尼
That's our Mr. Jackpots, Rodney.

184
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,630
我觉得也是  布拉德利
I think you're right, Bradley.

185
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,220
结果
Turns out,

186
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,620
我们的琼斯先生
our Mr. Jones

187
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,900
其实是...
is actually...

188
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,590
琼斯先生
Mr. Jones.

189
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,010
这世界真小
What a fuckin' world.

190
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,490
你...
How...

191
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,960
怎么可能会...
can you ever...

192
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,580
爱我...
love me...

193
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,210
我对你做了这么过分的事
...after what-what I-- what I did?

194
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,460
道吉
Dougie.

195
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,000
你觉得我迷人吗
Do you find me attractive?

196
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,150
你觉得吗
Well? Do you?

197
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,540
我觉得你很迷人
I find you attractive.

198
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,730
道吉
Dougie.

199
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,380
道吉  真棒
Dougie! Oh, yes.

200
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,360
好爽  道吉
Oh. Yes, Dougie.

201
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,940
好爽
Yes.

202
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,420
道吉
Dougie.

203
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,920
道吉  道吉
Dougie! Dougie!

204
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,860
道吉  道吉
Dougie. Dougie.

205
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,080
道吉
Dougie!

206
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,990
道吉  道吉
Dougie! Dougie!

207
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,510
道吉
Dougie!

208
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,700
道吉
Dougiiieee!

209
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,650
道吉
Dougie.

210
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,290
道吉
Oh, Dougie.

211
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,830
道吉
Dougie?

212
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,650
我爱你
I love you.

213
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,710
我爱你
Love you.

214
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,930
道吉
Dougie.

215
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,000
这些破事又上演了
And the fucks are at it again!

216
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,910
去你妈的  你背叛了你选择要帮助的人
Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help!

217
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,220
对这些怪物来说我们就像无助的羔羊
We're sheep to these monsters,

218
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,710
他们一点也不在乎我们
and they don't give a shit!

219
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,150
等着羊毛丰盈
We grow our wool,

220
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,280
当我们刚能自保温暖
and just when we're getting warm,

221
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,990
他们就会拿着电动剪刀
they come along with their electric clippers

222
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,940
把我们的羊毛剃个精光
and shear our wool off,

223
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,520
我们只是一群赤裸裸的尖叫着的小杂碎
and we're just naked, screaming little fucks!

224
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,870
没有羊毛留给我们
No wool for us!

225
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,990
饥寒交迫
Freezing and hungry!

226
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,990
挣扎在黑暗的夜中
In the night. In the dark.

227
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,500
他们一点也不会在乎
And they don't give a shit!

228
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,520
当我们病了
Then when we get sick,

229
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,550
制药公司就发了大财
the pharmaceutical companies make billions!

230
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,890
该死的医院是他们开的
They own the fucking hospitals.

231
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,980
挣得盆满钵盈
Filled to the brim.

232
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,580
太平间也是他们的
They own the morgues!

233
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,740
尸体防腐液也是他们的
They own the embalming fluids!

234
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,180
停尸房  墓地都是他们的
They own the mortuaries, the graveyards!

235
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,090
这些混蛋
These fucks!

236
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,670
我们要和谁结婚关政府什么屁事
Is it the government's business who we marry?

237
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,580
我们还他妈在乎
What the fuck do we care

238
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,980
政府对我们要和谁结婚有什么意见
what the government thinks about who we marry?

239
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,390
我们要请他们来参加婚礼吗
Are we gonna invite them to the wedding?

240
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,050
当然不
Fuck no!

241
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,460
反正他们也不会来的
Oh, they wouldn't come anyway.

242
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,840
他们...他们忙着压榨百姓
They're-they're too busy fucking!

243
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,750
在杂货店压榨我们
Fucking us at the grocery store!

244
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,890
在银行
At the bank!

245
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,490
在加油站
At the gas pump!

246
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,060
他们为我们的孩子吃有化学成分的糖果
They're feeding our children chemical shit coated in sugar!

247
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,760
为什么这群禽兽
Why don't these monsters

248
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,630
不买这些可口小吃
bite into those tasty treats themselves?

249
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,370
因为他们会死在大街上
Cause they'll die in the streets!

250
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,930
就像我们百姓一样
Just like us!

251
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,620
然后他们就会肿胀成一个红色气球
And then they'll bloat like a big red fucking balloon.

252
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,040
停下来
Stop!

253
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,810
别让这些屁话分散你们的注意力
Stop distracting yourself with all this diverting bullshit,

254
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,710
火力全开集中注意
and pay attention.

255
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,780
拯救孩子
Save the children!

256
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,460
每个父母都想救他们的孩子
Every parent wants to save their child.

257
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,710
自己想办法
Buy yourself a shovel,

258
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,440
把自己从这困境中救出来
dig yourself out of the shit,

259
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,710
而且要多读书
and get educated!

260
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,510
他真是英明
Oh, he's so beautiful.

261
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,000
桑尼·吉姆
Sonny Jim,

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,670
你先上车
go get in the car.

263
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,960
我一直在回味昨晚的事
I can't stop thinking about last night.

264
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,890
你真是棒极了
You're so wonderful.

265
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,400
棒极了
Wonderful.

266
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,860
我只是很想跟你分享
I just had to tell you that.

267
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,730
好了  先送你去上班
Okay. Let's get you to work.

268
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,180
你可不能骗我
You can't fool me!

269
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,060
我以前来过这里
I've been here before!

270
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,400
双峰镇警察局

271
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,340
你在这做什么  查德
What are you doing up here, Chad?

272
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,230
我...在想今天天气真好  露西
I'm... thinking what a beautiful day it is, Lucy.

273
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,310
我猜你是那种喜欢好天气的女生
I'll bet you're a girl who appreciates a beautiful day.

274
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,700
我猜你跟安迪每天醒来后会说
I bet you and Andy wake up each morning and say,

275
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,100
"今天天气真好啊"
"Oh, what a beautiful day it is."

276
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,850
那要看看我们几点起床
That depends on what time it is.

277
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,350
我意思是
I mean,

278
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,890
有时都没时间给我们去想事情
sometimes there's not even enough time to think of anything.

279
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:31,120
有一次  安迪还以为钟停了
One time, Andy was even thinking that the clock had stopped,

280
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,900
后来我们才意识到我们连几点都不知道
and then we realized that we didn't even know what time it was.

281
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,040
好像时间停住了一样
It seemed like forever.

282
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,120
当...
When--

283
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,050
我要出去了  露西
I'm going out, Lucy.

284
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,320
我...我看邮差来了  我去收一下信
I-I see the mailman. I'm gonna collect the mail.

285
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
他会拿进来的
But he'll bring it in.

286
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,340
我出去吧  不用麻烦他了
Well, I'm gonna save him the trouble

287
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,800

- she's got no place to go. - I know. I...

427
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,590
他来了
Here he is.

428
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,520
你俩刚刚才扯什么淡
What the fuck were you guys talking about?

429
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,500
是她在说
She was talking.

430
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,920
坎迪
Candie?

431
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:13,140
你刚刚在大厅跟他说什么了
What were you talking about to him out there on the floor?

432
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,040
坎迪
Candie!

433
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,360
我们处于交替期
That we're in the version layer,

434
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,940
明天会雾大且炎热
that it's gonna be hot and smoggy tomorrow,

435
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,230
我告诉他  我们很幸运
and I told him that we are so lucky

436
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,000
我们的赌场有空调制冷
to have air-conditioning cooling our casino.

437
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,130
好  保险员先生  你有何贵干
Okay. Mr. Insurance Man, what do you want?

438
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,090
米彻姆先生
Mr. Mitchum.

439
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
米彻姆先生
Mr. Mitchum.

440
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,120
我来告诉你们一件
I'm here to tell you something

441
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,570
你们会想知道的事情
that you will want to know about.

442
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,830
-是吗  -什么事
- Yeah? - What's that?

443
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,120
你的新酒店
Your new hotel,

444
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,700
几个月前被烧成灰烬的那个
which burned badly down to the ground a few months back,

445
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,960
在正式的调查后
was ruled arson

446
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,320
被判定为蓄意纵火
by an official investigation.

447
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,360
我或许给你们卖了保险  先生们
Now, I may have sold you your policy, sirs,

448
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,440
但理赔这事不是我处理的
but I didn't handle the claim.

449
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,420
是道格拉斯·琼斯负责的
It was done by Douglas Jones,

450
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,620
他是我们公司的员工
who works at our firm.

451
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,080
道格拉斯·琼斯
Douglas Jones.

452
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,260
我认为我该告诉你们  私下的
I thought you should know from me, unofficially,

453
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,370
以我个人的名义
on my own...

454
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,350
琼斯先生用尽他的一切权力
...that this Mr. Jones did everything in his power

455
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,030
阻止你们
to prevent you gentlemen

456
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,090
从损失中
from getting the insurance relief

457
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,320
获得我认为
from the loss you suffered

458
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,760
你们理应获得的赔偿
that I believe to this day you deserved.

459
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,400
道格拉斯·琼斯
Douglas Jones

460
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,350
似乎对你们有私人
seems to have a personal vendetta

461
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,590
仇恨
against you.

462
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,160
他仍坚持
And he still insists

463
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,480
不应该支付赔偿
that that claim will never be paid out,

464
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,660
他会尽他所能
and he'll do everything in his power

465
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,220
确保你们不会获得赔偿
to make sure that it never happens.

466
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,240
-是吗  -是吗
- Yeah? - Is that it?

467
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,770
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

468
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,680
你有个敌人  道格拉斯·琼斯
You have an enemy in Douglas Jones.

469
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,610
我就是来告诉你这个的
That's what I came to tell you.

470
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,400
坎迪  带他出去
Candie, show him out.

471
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,050
坎迪
Candie!

472
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,880
你有个敌人  道格拉斯·琼斯
You have an enemy... in Douglas Jones.

473
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,420
现在我知道...白兰度的感受了
Now I know... how Brando felt.

474
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,320
明天找那个
Calling him tomorrow,

475
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,140
道格拉斯·琼斯
this Douglas Jones...

476
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,030
见一面
...to set up a meeting.

477
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,700
听你的  罗德尼
Right you are, Rodney.

478
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,530
-听你的  -他卷走了我们
- Right you are. - He took us...

479
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,490
3044万
for 30 million...

480
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,660
7千
447 thousand...

481
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,400
美元
dollars.

482
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,620
该死
Motherfucker.

483
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,830
你玩我们一次  算我们倒霉
You fuck us once, shame on us.

484
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,150
你耍我们两次
You fuck us twice,

485
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,730
算你倒霉
shame on you.

486
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,420
你死定了
You're dead.

487
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,430
没错
Yeah.

488
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,810
劳拉
Laura!

489
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,610
艾伯特
Albert.

490
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,510
进来
Come on in.

491
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,940
戴安今早11点13分手机上收到这则消息
Diane received this text on her phone on 11:13 this morning.

492
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,750
晚饭时的谈话气氛很活跃
"Around the dinner table, the conversation is lively."

493
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,050
那是在库柏逃走后收到的
Now, that came in after Cooper escaped.

494
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,080
定位到费城的一个信号塔  所以一开始
It pinged off a cell tower in Philly, so at first,

495
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,900
我以为是她的一个男朋友
I thought it was one of her boyfriends--

496
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,210
她好像有不少男性追求者
seems she has a stable of male suitors--

497
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,660
但是塔米追踪到了一个墨西哥的服务器
but Tammy traced this one back from there to a server in Mexico.

498
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,510
墨西哥
Mexico?

499
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,070
她有回复吗
Did she respond?

500
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,090
她发了这些高度加密的信息
She sent the following heavily encrypted message:

501
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,210
他们抓到了黑斯廷斯
"They have Hastings.

502
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,850
他会带他们去那里
He's going to take them to the site."

503
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,040
听起来不像是对男朋友说的
Doesn't sound like boyfriend talk.

504
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,350
她抱我的时候我就有所感觉
I felt it when she hugged me,

505
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,910
但这样一来就确认了
but this confirms it.

506
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,280
我们该怎么办
What should we do?

507
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,890
盯紧她
Keep her close.

508
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,010
该死
Damn.

509
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,240
-塔米  -戈登
- Tammy. - Gordon.

510
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,610
进来
Come on in.

511
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,660
你们还记得纽约楼顶的那个谋杀案吗
You remember the penthouse murders in New York City?

512
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,030
记得
Yes?

513
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,660
这是最开始拍下的画面中发现的
This was just found on one of the earliest cards.

514
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,020
戴尔
Dale!

515
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,670
这可不得了
This is something.

516
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,740
这可太不得了了
This is really something.

517
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,100
他组哦了什么
What did he do?

518
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,930
他进来袭击了我们  偷走了我所有的钱
He came in and attacked us and stole all my money!

519
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,370
该死
Damn it.

520
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,510
约翰尼没事吧
Is Johnny okay?

521
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,070
和往常一样一点都不关心我
No concerns for me, as usual.

522
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,760
你问约翰尼是什么意思  被袭击的是我
What do you mean, Johnny? It was me he attacked.

523
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,010
西尔维娅  我当然
Sylvia, of course

524
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,270
也关心你
I'm concerned about you too.

525
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,880
他拿走了多少钱
How much money did he take?

526
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,510
我保险箱里的所有东西
Everything I had in the safe,

527
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,870
有好几千
thousands of dollars,

528
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,060
你要补偿我
and you're going to make this up to me.

529
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,370
不  我不会再给你钱了  西尔维娅
No, I am not sending you any more money, Sylvia!

530
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,070
你要给我
Yes, you are!

531
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,570
-西尔维娅  -你要给我
- Sylvia! - Yes, you are.

532
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,250
我现在就打给我的律师
I'm calling my lawyer right now.

533
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,260
贝弗莉
Beverly?

534
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,310
要和我一起吃晚餐吗
Do you want to have dinner with me?

535
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,920
霍克
Hawk.

536
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,880
电流在涌动
Electricity is humming.

537
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,760
你能在山间水边听到
You hear it in the mountains and rivers.

538
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,680
你能看到它在海边  在星星上
You see it dance among the seas and stars

539
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:51,120
在月亮上闪耀
and glowing around the moon,

540
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
但是最近
but in these days,

541
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,950
亮光越来越弱了
the glow is dying.

542
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,290
剩下的黑暗中  还会有什么
What will be in the darkness that remains?

543
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,790
杜鲁门兄弟都是真正的男人
The Truman brothers are both true men.

544
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,590
他们是你的兄弟
They are your brothers.

545
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,530
还有其他人
And the others,

546
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,560
一直和你一起的好人
the good ones who have been with you.

547
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,890
现在轮回几乎完成了
Now the circle is almost complete.

548
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,440
仔细聆听  欣赏时间和空间的
Watch and listen to the dream of time

549
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,040
梦
and space.

550
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,740
现在都将涌现  如同一条河流
It all comes out now, flowing like a river.

551
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,530
不管存不存在
That which is and is not.

552
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,890
霍克
Hawk.

553
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,420
是劳拉
Laura is the one.

554
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:30,570
